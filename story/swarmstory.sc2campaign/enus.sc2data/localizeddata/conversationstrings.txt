Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00030=There is still time for me to stop you!
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00031=I have enough eggs. Abathur, infuse the birthing pond. Get those eggs to hatch for me.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00032=Simple. Catalytic solution, accelerated quickening. Army ready in a moment.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00033=And now, Zagara will [Serious]regret crossing me.[/Serious]
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00034=I'm halfway done, human. Soon I will spawn an army that will crush you.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00035=Broodmother Zagara is three quarters of the way to collecting the eggs she needs.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00036=I am almost done, Kerrigan. Then I will be the heart of the Swarm.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00037=Halfway there.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00038=You are halfway to amassing enough eggs to overwhelm Zagara's hive cluster.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00039=Just a little more...
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00040=You almost have enough eggs to overwhelm Zagara's hive cluster.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00041=Don't think finding those pathetic baneling nests will save you!
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00042=Zagara has recovered more eggs than you.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00043=Now it only remains to recover all the dormant eggs.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00044=I am better than you. Faster and more powerful!
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00045=How did you take down so many feral creatures? You shouldn't be that powerful...
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00046=You kill me with minions!
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00047=At least fight me yourself!
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00048=You don't even return to defend your own hive cluster? How strong are you?
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00049=[Serious]Something[/Serious] is different about this nest.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00051=That could be very useful.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00052=Zagara has deep tunneled back to her base to recover her strength. She will return.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00053=We should defend our hive cluster. Spine crawlers are excellent defenses for our hives.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00054=A minor setback!
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00055=This will not stop me!
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00056=I have returned, and now you shall pay.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00057=Did you think you were rid of me?
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00058=I will let you live, Zagara.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00059=I can sense the unhatched eggs. Now I just have to get them before Zagara.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00060=Zagara...
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00061=Halfway there.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00062=Just a little more...
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00063=These eggs are [Serious]different [/Serious]than the others.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00064=Good. I can use the additional forces.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00065=Now to take down Zagara.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00066=I have enough eggs. Abathur, infuse the birthing pond. Get those eggs to hatch for me.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00067=And now, [Serious]I will take back my brood.[/Serious]
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00068=Kill her.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00069=Hold.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00070=I told you to rebel against me?
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00071=I will let you live, Zagara.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00072=I want to rebuild the Swarm, and [Serious]you[/Serious] are a part of that plan.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00087=You are not the Queen of Blades! You have no claim here, traitor!
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00088=I am halfway done, false queen. Soon I will spawn an army that will crush you.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00089=Enough. While you've been stealing eggs, I've been making troops. Let me remind you how the zerg fight!
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00090=You have such power!
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00091=I am eternal as long as the Swarm survives.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00092=I am the true Queen of the Zerg. Faster and more powerful!
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00093=How did you take down so many feral creatures? I am the Queen of the Swarm...
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00094=You don't even return to defend your own hive cluster? How arrogant are you?
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00095=That could be very useful.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00096=Where is this false Queen of Blades? Do you not have the strength to meet me in battle?
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00097=Banelings very useful. [Angry 70]Morph[/Angry] from zerglings. Any zergling can [Angry 70]morph[/Angry] to baneling.

Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00113=I'll destroy them if I get a chance.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00114=We should destroy them if possible, so that all zerg will know you rule the Swarm, and Char.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00116=We destroyed one of the infested terran structures. [Surprise 70]One more[/Surprise] remains.
Conversation/zMission_Char01/Line00117=We destroyed the last infested terran structure.

Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Group00024=TO Consider
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Group00028=OBSOLETE
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00001=Yeah, I have it.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00002=Are you able to control it?
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00004=Left-click the drone to select it.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00006=Okay. The next step: See if you can order the drone to mutate into a hatchery.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00007=On the drone's command card, left-click on the "Basic Mutation" button.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00008=Now left-click on the "Mutate into Hatchery" button, and place the hatchery by left-clicking.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00010=You think we're done? Let's put your controlled environment to the test.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00012=Don't worry, you can control a few zerg without turning back into the Queen of Blades.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00013=Shut down the experiment. Sanitize the holding cells!
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00014=The door is malfunctioning.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00015=The hatchery also produces larvae, which you use to morph into more drones or other zerg creatures.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00017=To create zerglings, left-click on the "Select Larva" button on the command card.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00019=[Happy 60]Excellent.[/Happy] I planned to stop here, but let's take this a little further.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00020=Left-click a drone, then right-click a mineral node to order them to harvest.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00022=Great work, Kerrigan; I think that's all we need today.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00023=Most zerg structures need to be placed on creep.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00024=[Surprise 80]Luck had nothing to do with it.[/Surprise] And maybe now you understand how [Serious]dangerous the zerg are[/Serious]. I'll send them back to their pens.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00025=I need an overlord to morph anything else.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00026=[Surprise]You're giving me more zerg to control.[/Surprise] You like to live dangerously, [Surprise 70]don't you?[/Surprise]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00027=A hatchery is the central structure of a zerg base. It spreads creep, so that other structures can be built.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00028=[Serious]Do it then.[/Serious] One overlord shouldn't hurt.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00029=It is also the only structure which produces units, once the necessary upgrades have been built.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00030=Additional drones are still available to harvest minerals. 
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00031=Several drones are available in the testing area. Please left-click one now to select it.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00033=[Surprise 60]See if you can order them[/Surprise] to gather those resources.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00034=You're doing well, Kerrigan. [Surprise 70]Can you morph more drones?[/Surprise]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00035=Select drones by left-clicking.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00036=This will order them to start harvesting minerals.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00037=Before you can train a unit, you must have the supplies to support that unit.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00038=Your current supply maximum is displayed in the upper right corner of the screen along with how much supply you are currently using.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00039=To mutate a zerg structure, first select a drone by left-clicking.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00040=The hatchery cannot be placed too close to minerals.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00041=The Drone is consumed when the structure is created, so you will need another Drone to build another structure.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00042=[Surprise]I appreciate that.[/Surprise] I'm opening your cell right now,[Serious] if you'd like[/Serious] to join me.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00043=Select your hatchery and left-click the "Select Larva" button, then order a larva to morph into an Overlord.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00044=Kerrigan, why did you stop the hatchery from mutating?
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00045=This is a really bad idea.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00046=The zerg use overlords to generate more supply.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00047=To morph an overlord left-click on the "Select Larva" button on the command card.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00048=Try mutating a drone into a spawning pool.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00050=The spawning pool allows the hatchery to turn larvae into zerglings.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00051=Zerglings are the basic unit of any zerg army.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00052=There are only a few tests left. Please continue.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00053=The spawning pool is finished. [Happy 90]You should go down to the test chamber and inspect it.[/Happy]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00054=Then left-click on the "Morph to Zergling" button on the command card.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00056=[Surprise 80]Stop![/Surprise][Angry 75] I didn't ask you to create zerglings![/Angry]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00057=Funny thing about zerg, Valerian. [Serious]They never do what you expect.[/Serious]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00058=Seal the door!
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00059=There's creep in the circuits. [Happy 60]Fancy that.[/Happy]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00060=[Serious]Lockdown on the sublevel and power up the Eradicator![/Serious][Angry 65] Nothing gets out![/Angry]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00061=Containment breach. Zerg specimens free.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00062=Evacuate the scientists! Get all personnel out of there!
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00063=I sense more zerglings in holding pens![Surprise 90] Valerian, you were very careless! [Serious]Perhaps[/Surprise] I'll free them too...[/Serious]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00064=Kerrigan! [Serious]This is not a game![/Serious]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00065=It never is with the zerg.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00066=Activating automated sentry bots.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00067=Activating automated defense turrets.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00070=Zerg! Run!
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00072=[Angry 65]Dammit, [Serious]get[/Angry] all personnel off that level![/Serious]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00073=I thought you said you needed an overlord to create more units?
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00075=Activating more automated sentry bots.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00077=Eradicator activated.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00078=Activate gas and turrets.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00079=Activate Warbot shield.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00082=The zerg have overrun the sublevel. [Serious 80]You're lucky no one was killed, Kerrigan.[/Serious]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00084=Adjutant, deploy firebats to the sublevel. Without Kerrigan commanding them, they should be easy to clean up.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00085=I guess you found out how many zerg I can command. Huge success.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00086=Oh, I just don't like you.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00087=[Surprise 90]Again? [/Surprise]We need to finish these tests and we don't have much time.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00089=You could always let me out of this cell and speed things along...
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00090=Dammit, Kerrigan, call off your zerglings.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00091=You do it, Valerian.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00092=You've made your point, Kerrigan!
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00093=[Surprise 90]Not yet I haven't. [Happy 90]I'm[/Surprise] still in your containment cell.[/Happy]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00094=More zerg? What were you thinking?
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00096=Ah, I can see just fine from up here, thanks.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00097=A warbot? If the zerg get out, a warbot won't be enough. Here, I'll show you.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00099=Can you mutate a drone to a spine crawler?
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00100=[Surprise 60]You know this[/Surprise] is going to [Serious]end badly, [/Serious][Surprise 60]right?[/Surprise]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00101=We have a [Serious]controlled environment.[/Serious]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00102=[Surprise 60]Okay, Kerrigan,[/Surprise] I'm releasing more drones into the test chamber.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00103=Okay, it's morphing into a spine crawler.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00104=There you go, one perfectly secure spine crawler.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00106=Oops, looks like these other zerglings are beyond my control. Good luck dealing with them.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00108=It's all... out of control.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00109=But they can still cause some chaos on their own.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00111=I understand that the zerg are dangerous, but we've taken every precaution.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00113=Not at all. In fact, it will help, quite a bit.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00114=You know this is going to end badly, right?
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00116=Automated gas defense activated.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00118=No more personnel remain on sublevel.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00121=I've... I've lost control of them.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00122=The bridge is extended. This will make reinforcing my zerglings easier.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00123=Kerrigan, the Spawning Pool did not finish mutating. [Surprise]Did you tell it to stop?[/Surprise]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00125=[Serious]I can't morph any more... [/Serious][Surprise 85]of course,[/Surprise] I need another overlord.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00126=[Surprise 80]Where did my drones go?[/Surprise] Oh -- they get used up when I morph them.[Happy 80] It's coming back to me.[/Happy]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00127=To mutate a spine crawler, first select a drone by left-clicking.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00128=Then left-click "Basic Mutation" on the command card, and left-click on "Mutate into Spine Crawler."
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00130=Now left-click on the "Morph to Overlord" button on the command card.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00131=Yes. This is a terrible idea...
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00132=Kerrigan, this isn't funny.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00133=And I'm not laughing... Let me out.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00134=You've already demonstrated that the zerg can be ordered to stop mutating. [Serious]This isn't a game.[/Serious]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00135=And yet you insist on treating the zerg like toys.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00136=Left-click to select your hatchery.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00137=The drone mutating into a spine crawler has stopped. Can you order it to restart the process?
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00138=You realize spine crawlers kill people, right Valerian?
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00139=Stop this Kerrigan. You're wasting our time.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00140=I have all the time in the world, Valerian.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00141=Kerrigan. Stop this. Now.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00142=Or what? You'll imprison me? Perform tests on me?
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00143=Kerrigan... Please focus on finishing the tests. It's almost over.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00144=I assure you everything is under control.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00145=The drone is the harvesting unit of the zerg. They can gather minerals and return them to your hatchery.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00146=[Angry 80]Kerrigan, call off your...[/Angry][Surprise] drones? You're attacking with drones?[/Surprise]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00147=Select zerglings by left-clicking, then right-click the enemy to order them to attack.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00148=This is taking too long. I need more zerglings.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00149=If I can extend this bridge, my zerglings can move through this facility faster.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00150=Testing. (beeping) No playback errors detected. Repeating instructions.

Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00153=Possible hardware failure. Testing audio response: Your sound card works perfectly.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00157=The only thing you're testing is my patience.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00158=I've been poked and prodded enough.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00159=Left-click "Basic Mutation" on the command card, then left-click on "Mutate into Spawning Pool."
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00160=Oh, don't let me keep you.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00161=Please cooperate, [Serious]we have a short timetable.[/Serious]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00162=I can't remember... and I'm not sure I want to.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00163=How does the drone survive that?
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00165=Your drones are under attack.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00166=This structure must be placed on creep.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00167=What is it?
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00168=Additional overlords required.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00169=Placement invalid.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00170=Your drones are unable to reach that location.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00172=Eradicator destroyed. Situation critical.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00173=This is taking too long. I should morph more zerglings at the hatchery.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00174=Containment door closed.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00175=That containment door won't open until I destroy the gas turrets.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00176=Kerrigan, what are you doing?
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00177=Maybe if I destroy your pretty Eradicator, [Serious]you'll learn you can't control the zerg.[/Serious]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00179=And perhaps next time you can make your point without [Serious]destroying half the facility?[/Serious]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00180=When you use larvae, the hatchery will replenish them over time.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00181=If you do not have enough available supply, you will not be able to morph a unit.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00182=Now right-click on a mineral field.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00183=(scoff)
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00184=Kerrigan?
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00185=Then right-click on a mineral field.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00186=Putting your [Serious]controlled environment to the test.[/Serious]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00187=If you think that was great work, [Serious]wait 'til you see this.[/Serious] [Happy 80]I'll make some zerglings...[/Happy]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00188=[Surprise 80]Ah, I can see just fine[/Surprise] from up here, [Happy 60]thanks.[/Happy] I think that's all we need today, Kerrigan. [Happy 80]Great work.[/Happy]
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00189=Shut down the experiment. Get sentry bots in there to sanitize those holding cells!
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00190=Right-click on an enemy, and the zerglings will attack.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00191=Those sentry bots are destroying the zerglings in their pens. I can change that...
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00193=We killed your zergling and it... respawned back at the hatchery! That shouldn't be possible!
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00194=Anything's possible with the zerg, Valerian. You'll learn.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00195=That containment door won't open until I destroy those turrets!
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00196=Eradicator engaging.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00197=There's the Eradicator!
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00198=More zerglings. Good, I can use them.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00199=More zerglings? You like to live dangerously, don't you?
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00200=[Surprise]You have more zerglings here? [/Surprise]Well, they're mine now.
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00201=[Surprise]Even more zerglings![/Surprise] Valerian, you've been [Serious]playing with fire.[/Serious][Happy 70] Time to get burned.[/Happy]

Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00206=That gas is hurting my zerglings!
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00207=That gas is hurting my drones!
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00208=That gas is hurting the zerg!
Conversation/zMission_Lab01/Line00209=[Happy 90]Aww, look Valerian. [/Happy][Serious]I think he likes you![/Serious]

Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00052=Those marines are clustered pretty tight. I should be able to handle them all with crushing grip.

Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00092=[Surprise 70]Keep going! [/Surprise]There's only [Serious]one more door[/Serious] between you and the [Serious 60]tram station![/Serious]
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00093=I sense a lot of Dominion in the next room.
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00094=Looks like a rough fight.
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00095=They have caged zerg in there. We can use this console to set them loose.
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00096=Or we can use it to activate the gas defenses.
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00097=[Surprise 80]Oh well,[/Surprise][Happy 75] it evened the odds. Let's hit it![/Happy]
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00098=Gas didn't get all of them.

Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00151=We've only got one engine left![Angry 70] Protect it![/Angry]
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00152=We're outta the labs. We're exposed out here until we reach the shuttle bay.
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00153=They've locked the door! We're gonna have to go around.
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00154=The tram's taking too much damage!
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00155=The way is clear! Move out!
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00156=Isn't there -- [Surprise]Really Jim?[/Surprise][Happy 80] (laughs) Six years later and you're still a pig.[/Happy]
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00158=What can I say? [Happy 80]Old habits die hard.[/Happy]

Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00163=We got to move!
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00164=Those doors will lock if we don't move!

Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00171=Yes, [Serious]I can sense them down there.[/Serious] But I don't think I should control them again.
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00172=I won't ask you to do that. We'll handle them.
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00173=Alright, Blondie, [Angry 80]take your shot![/Angry]
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00174=We're going to have to keep them off our ride.

Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00176=He kept us here too long, Jim. We should have been on the move a week ago. This is his fault.
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00179=Right.
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00181=[Surprise 60]A siege tank![/Surprise] I can take it out with a kinetic blast.
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00182=Raynor, Kerrigan! This recovery terminal will heal you and restore some of your energy!
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00183=I found another way out, I'll be right behind you. Just get to the rendezvous!
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00184=Roger that, Valerian. Hail us when you're on the bridge.
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00185=[Happy 60]Just you and me now, Jim. [/Happy][Serious]Let's move out.[/Serious]
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00186=[Surprise 70]Raynor, Kerrigan![/Surprise] I'm on the Hyperion, we're [Serious 70]setting course[/Serious] for the rendezvous. [Surprise 70]What is your status?[/Surprise]
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00187=[Serious]Kerrigan is taking my drop ship.[/Serious] I need extraction.

Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00189=Kerrigan, I'll see you at the rendezvous. And... [Serious]I'm sorry [/Serious]I didn't listen to you sooner.
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00190=Jim, Dominion reinforcements are arriving. The Hyperion is taking heavy fire and my team [Surprise 80]can't reach you[/Surprise].
Conversation/zMission_Lab02/Line00191=Roger that. Get the Hyperion to the rendezvous! I'll find another way off world.

Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00007=There are more zerglings in this cave, my queen.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00017=It's a wonder you survived at all without me.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00018=When the Dominion arrived, they drove some of my brood into caves.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00019=They will rejoin us if we can kill the terran soldiers guarding the cave entrances.

Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00021=More of my zerglings! The brood grows stronger!
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00022=We don't have much time. I need more larvae to grow this brood.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00023=The hatchery continually spawns larvae.

Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00045=The Dominion is so weakened! Arise my brood! Attack!
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00050=Get those bunkers in place, boys!
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00069=My queen, you evolved us to store your essence in the nearest hatchery.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00070=If you die and there is a hatchery nearby, we can resurrect you.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00071=Your essence is stored in the hatchery at the main hive cluster. Any time you die, we can resurrect you.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00072=[Surprise 70]Where is Jim? [/Surprise]He should have contacted me by now.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00074=Our drones can mutate into spine crawlers. They will bolster the hive cluster's defenses.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00075=(coughing) I'm alive?
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00076=But if you wish to spawn even more larvae for a short time, the queen can induce the hatchery to do so.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00090=In order to grow this brood, you will need to spawn more overlords.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00092=Yes, queens have many useful abilities. You can birth a queen at the hatchery.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00101=We need to morph more zerglings before we engage the Dominion.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00103=Morphing additional drones will allow us to harvest minerals faster.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00104=This is taking too long. I need a queen to help grow this hive cluster.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00105=Until my brood comes to your aid, I will advise you however I can.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00106=We will need resources for the fight. You can order your drones to gather minerals from the mineral fields.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00108=You can order a drone to mutate into a spawning pool, allowing your brood to create zerglings and more.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00109=It is possible to morph zerglings from the larvae at your hatchery.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00110=By morphing more drones at the hatchery, your brood will gather minerals faster.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00111=The queen can use "Transfusion" to heal this spine crawler.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00112=The creep has spread. You can move that spine crawler to the hive cluster's entrance and root it there.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00113=[Surprise 65]Okay.[/Surprise] Let's see if I can remember how to do this. The first thing I need is a spawning pool.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00114=Spine crawlers will help defend the hive cluster when you get attacked.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00115=You can mutate a drone into a spine crawler near the entrance of the hive cluster.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00116=Vespene gas is required for the evolution of complex zerg forms like queens.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00118=You can order a drone to build an extractor upon a vespene geyser.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00119=My queen, I sent you some more zerg!
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00120=Some zerg to help you!
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00121=I send you some of my brood!
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00122=Command, we've found Kerrigan! She's holed up in a zerg base!

Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00137=[Surprise 65]Okay.[/Surprise] Let's see if I can remember how to do this. The first thing I need is a spawning pool.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00138=This is taking too long. I need a queen to help grow this hive cluster.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00139=We don't have much time. I need more larvae to grow this brood.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00140=What else? If I could only remember... creep. We need creep all over this hive cluster.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00141=We need to morph more zerglings before we engage the Dominion.

Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00144=It's a wonder you survived at all without me.
Conversation/zMission_Lab03/Line00145=We should spread creep as far as we can.

Conversation/zMission_Space01/Line00065=Don't forget to upgrade the Hyperion or her weapons. The cowboy wouldn't have forgot.

Conversation/zMission_Space01/Line00070=[Surprise 70]Hey kids, [/Surprise]the asteroids ahead are too dense to navigate. You'll have to do a short range jump to get past 'em.
Conversation/zMission_Space01/Line00071=[Happy 90]Nice.[/Happy] Those short jumps are good for getting outta danger too.
Conversation/zMission_Space01/Line00072=Give her a spin on that tower.

Conversation/zMission_Space01/Line00082=[Angry 90]Matthew! You stole all my minerals![/Angry]
Conversation/zMission_Space01/Line00083=Y'know you can "Jump" into the middle of the fight, then use the "Electric Field!"
Conversation/zMission_Space01/Line00084=Just remember, it won't damage enemy craft until we've upgraded it a few times. Before that, it just disables 'em.
Conversation/zMission_Space01/Line00105=The Hyperion can salvage some resources from the wreckage of enemy craft.
Conversation/zMission_Space01/Line00106=They come at you in a straight line so you can dodge 'em. [Surprise 80]Or even[/Surprise] use "Jump" to get outta their way.
Conversation/zMission_Space01/Line00107=I got teams repairing the Hyperion and replacing lost tac fighers around the clock.
Conversation/zMission_Space01/Line00108=It takes time though, so take care of my baby.

Conversation/zMission_Space01/Line00110=[Surprise 80]Hey,[/Surprise] the Hyperion's even stronger now.[Happy 80] You can thank me later.[/Happy]
Conversation/zMission_Space01/Line00111=Upgrade's finished. If you can name it, [Happy 80]I made it better[/Happy]. Get more minerals and I'll do it again.
Conversation/zMission_Space01/Line00113=Alright, she's all upgraded. [Serious]I don't think we can squeeze any more out of her.[/Serious]
Conversation/zMission_Space01/Line00114=[Surprise 80]Hey, mag mines![/Surprise] Those babies pack a punch.

Conversation/zMission_Space01/Line00120=[Happy 75]Nice work. [/Happy]Let's keep pushing forward.

Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00001=Spin sequences. Spin. Good.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00002=Swarm not good enough. Not!
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00003=Perfection. Deep in the core, in strands.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00004=Spin strands backward? No. Inside-out zergling, not efficient.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00005=Can evolve units at any time. Start with zergling.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00006=Many benefits to evolving Swarm. Start with zergling.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00007=Evolved zerglings much more efficient in battle.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00041=Dislike staying in space. Very little biomatter. Lack of essence.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00042=Primal zerg. Unacceptable. Primal zerg take. Unacceptable.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00043=Primal Queen of Blades transfiguration. Weaving of essence so subtle. Must learn.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00044=Fix broodmother. Broodmother damaged without cause. More work.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00045=Primal zerg. Messy, wild. Swarm, directed, focused. Preferable.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00046=Char same. Location unimportant. Strands, sequences, spinning. Important.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00047=New essence unavailable on Char. Char too familiar.

Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00057=Zerus, birthplace of zerg. Should not return. Evolve forward, not back.

Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00061=Space slightly colder than Kaldir. However, vacuum does not conduct heat. No moisture. Different conditions.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00062=Terran main hive. Distinct lack of essence diversity.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00063=Terrans too similar. Recessive trait upon recessive trait. Doomed.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00064=Other planets, better essence than this one.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00065=Primal zerg. Useful against Psi Destroyer. Still inferior.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00066=Swarm not evolving here. Lack of evolution deadly.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_EvolutionMaster/Line00067=Organism Abathur most useful part of Swarm.

Conversation/zSMAmbient_PrimalZergAdvisor/Line00029=We will go and gather essence. We will go soon?
Conversation/zSMAmbient_PrimalZergAdvisor/Line00030=My pack is large.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_PrimalZergAdvisor/Line00031=My pack is large. I will collect some of their essence.

Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00001=Vision. Such a strange idea.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00002=The zerg did not come from Char, but it is a perfect place for us.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00003=Someday I will lead the Swarm. But not today.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00004=This is the main hive of the terrans?
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00005=The terrans are tightly packed here.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00006=We should make this our main hive world.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00007=The Swarm can make a home here. The Swarm can live anywhere!
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00008=The Swarm conquers all.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00009=Again we see there is no planet the terrans can possess which the Swarm cannot take away.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00010=These buildings need more creep.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00011=The terrans are inferior. They should make a small contribution to the Swarm before they die out.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00012=Char is a good world. But any planet with lifeforms that could enrich the Swarm is a good world.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00017=Nafash was always clever. A little too clever, it seems.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00019=Nafash's brood had many strong adaptations. But they were few in number.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00020=With my strength and Nafash's adaptations, I could have driven the terrans from Char.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00021=I am learning from you, my queen. You are here to strengthen your Swarm for the fight ahead.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00022=I hope we will not make this our main hive world?
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00023=We sprang from these primal zerg? But they are so... chaotic.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00024=If our origins are on this world, we have clearly evolved a great deal.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00025=We will grow stronger here.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00026=You have transcended your origin. You will lead us forever.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00027=You are something new. Your power burns bright, but it is steady, as if it will never go out.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00028=Truly, this world is yours now.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00029=The Swarm came from Zerus. And now the Swarm owns Zerus.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00030=Hybrid are an abomination.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00031=The creature Stukov is unlike any zerg I have encountered.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00032=I cannot control Stukov.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00033=Stukov and Dehaka both attend you, my queen. But you and I are the Swarm!
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00034=The terrans hide in their shell. But we will peel it.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00035=I dislike space. It is cold and empty. Give me a turgid, wet hatchery.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_RogueQueen/Line00036=Let us land on a world and devour it!

Conversation/zSMAmbient_Stukov/Line00003=You are... different than you were. That does not mean better.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_Stukov/Line00004=How strange that two humans should be here, now, with the Swarm.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_Stukov/Line00005=If Amon is alive once more, I wonder if there is any hope for us at all?
Conversation/zSMAmbient_Stukov/Line00006=This place, so like Earth, but so different.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_Stukov/Line00007=The humans of the Koprulu sector are truly lost children.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_Stukov/Line00008=Someday the forces of Earth will return to this sector.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_Stukov/Line00010=Not the sort of spacecraft I am used to, but it is good to be aloft once more.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_Stukov/Line00012=The moment of your revenge draws near. Will it be what you expect?
Conversation/zSMAmbient_Stukov/Line00013=I spent four long years in that lab. I wish to see it fall from the sky, ablaze.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_Stukov/Line00014=Even though we have been enemies in the past, I am glad you brought your Swarm here.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_Stukov/Line00015=Growing up, I always wished to travel between the stars. The strange things I've seen...
Conversation/zSMAmbient_Stukov/Line00016=This view makes me think of an old comrade. Gerard. Sleep well, my friend.
Conversation/zSMAmbient_Stukov/Line00017=If you wish to save James Raynor, I will not speak against it.

Conversation/zSMBriefing_Korhal02/Line00023=Yes, and we're going to let them think we're diverted.
Conversation/zSMBriefing_Korhal02/Line00024=The device uses this psi connection you share. But I do not have a psi connection. I will not need it.

Conversation/zSMBriefing_Zerus01/Line00031=Very well. I'll awaken this Ancient One, and if the primal zerg try to stop me, they'll learn what the Swarm can do.
Conversation/zSMBriefing_Zerus01/Line00032=You are on the path, and no longer need my guidance. You will not see me again, Kerrigan.

Conversation/zSM_CharFortress/Line00006=It doesn't matter. We're the Swarm, we can sacrifice thousands for each one of their soldiers.
Conversation/zSM_CharFortress/Line00009=The Dominion sure made themselves at home while I was gone.

Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00004=Is that an excuse?
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00005=Wasteful to spin unnecessary adaptations. Complexity bad.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00006=Kaldir as cold as deep space. Other than leviathan, no reason to specialize Swarm for such cold.

Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00018=Look at flesh, see only potential. Strands, sequences, twisting, separating, joining. See how it could be better.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00019=Eat flesh, splinter bone. Inside me, can touch it. Weave it. Spin it.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00020=But not perfect?
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00021=Never perfect. Perfection goal that changes. Never stops moving. Can chase, cannot catch.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00022=Make it great.

Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00038=Rare terran individuals, high psionic potential. Overcome flawed origins.

Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00069=Weak and soft. Broke bones. Tore flesh. Improved you.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00070=Ah!
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00071=Abathur, I have a special project for you.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00072=Improving the entire Swarm. Will make time.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00073=I want you to spin a special creature for me. But I'm going to have you design its sequences in pieces.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00074=Show me entirety of vision. Can improve your design. My function.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00075=It is my will that we do it this way.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00076=I see it. Elegant. Can be improved, but good. Something familiar about it.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00077=Just spin the sequence I asked for. I'll have more later.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00078=Abathur, my special project continues. I have another sequence I wish you to spin.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00079=Two sequences, good. Enough for me to deduce creature's purpose. Improve it.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00080=I don't think so. You see, before I share the second one with you, I'm going to wipe your memory of the first.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00081=Does not make sense. I can... I can...
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00082=Abathur, I wish you to spin a creature for me. Here is the first sequence.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00083=I see it. Elegant. Can be improved, but good. Something familiar about it.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00084=Do you have the final sequence of the creature I've asked you to spin?
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00085=Final? Only the first.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00086=You've spun hundreds of sequences, but I've been erasing your memory of each one.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00087=Hundreds? Implies great complexity. Rarely good.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00088=Oh this one is complex, but it will be your finest work. Aside from the time you destroyed my body.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00089=When I transfigured you. Made you more than you were.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00090=Just give me the last sequence.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00092=[Serious]When you say things like that, Abathur... I almost remember you and I feel... [/Serious][Angry]anger.[/Angry]
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00093=What did you do after the Overmind died?
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00094=You aren't zerg unless you are under someone's control?
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00095=You're... telling me I'm not angry? Don't ever tell me what I feel.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00096=Yes. Moment of your creation. Broke you over and over. Made you perfect.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00097=I'm going to look into your memories, [Serious]and find out why I feel so angry when I see you.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00098=You left no part of me untouched. I want you to have that memory in your mind when you meet...
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00099=Unclear. Am the finest creature in the Swarm. Keep it strong. No need to make new version.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00100=Your replacement is every bit as talented as you. There is only one difference between the two of you.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00101=What difference?
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00102=He never broke me over and over.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00103=Just spin it.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00104=The pain was incredible. With everything I've lost, I've never forgotten that.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00109=Wasted effort. Creatures will die soon. Pain irrelevant.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00110=If you [Serious]weren't important[/Serious] to my plans, you'd [Angry 85]be dead right now.[/Angry]
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00111=Unclear.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00113=Cannot improve design if unclear about the totality of--
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00114=I said it is my will. You will not know the entire design of this creature. I will show you the sequence.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00115=Ah... yes. I will create this creature soon.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00116=You're... telling me I'm not angry? Don't ever tell me what I feel.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00117=Genetic strands different. Restructured from base level up.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00119=Stronger than Queen of Blades. Sequences complex but clean. Completely different at core. 
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00120=[Angry 70]Difficult to admit.[/Angry] New structure beyond understanding. Will return to work.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00132=Yes, I am different. I am my own master. When the xel'naga artifact made me human again, it cleansed me of Amon's influence.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00133=And that allowed me to become... something greater.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00136=I see it in your mind... [Surprise 80]You designed the Queen of Blades! [/Surprise][Angry 75]Your limbs wrapped me in the chrysalis![/Angry]
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00138=If you [Serious]weren't important[/Serious] to my plans, you'd [Angry 85]be dead right now.[/Angry]

Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00149=Ah... yes. I will create this creature soon.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00150=Not this time, Abathur.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00151=Do it.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00152=There is no other creature like you in the Swarm. [Surprise 60]Where did your essence come from?[/Surprise]
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00153=There is no other creature like you in the Swarm. [Surprise 60]Where did your essence come from?[/Surprise]
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00154=Anger product of adrenaline, stress-response, imminent threat. No threat to you. No anger.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00155=Tell me about the changes you made to Zagara.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00156=Broodmother template already allowed complex problem solving, learning, ability to command broods, multiple focuses.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00157=Now added muscle density, expanded brain matter. Now able to hypothesize multiple scenarios. Cognitive [Angry 70]flexibility.[/Angry]
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00158=Perhaps I should add this to all future broodmothers.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00159=Extraneous brain matter deemed unnecessary for broodmother role in Swarm. Extra matter requires extra energy.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00161=[Serious]Times are changing.[/Serious] I want my minions as dangerous as possible.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00162=Times are changing. I want my minions as [Serious]dangerous [/Serious]as possible.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00163=Perhaps I should add this to all future broodmothers.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00164=Tell me about the changes you made to Zagara.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00165=What do you think of the primal zerg?
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00166=Dynamic. Varied. Interesting. [Angry 70]Messy. Unsuccessful.[/Angry]
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00167=I thought you'd like them. As individuals they constantly evolve to be more efficient killers.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00168=Primal zerg, reactionary, improvised. Some good sequences, can steal.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00170=Swarm, [Angry 70]efficient,[/Angry] careful improvements. Successful.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00171=How so?
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00172=Organism Stukov fascinating. Implications disturbing.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00173=Interweaving of terran and zerg matter, subtle. Spun on micro scale not possible for Swarm.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00174=Something out there is better at this than you, [Happy 75]and you don't like it.[/Happy]
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00175=Modifications of Stukov second only to modifications of Primal Queen of Blades. However, Stukov product of specific design.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00176=Entity responsible for Stukov exceeds organism Abathur. Untenable to oppose.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00177=Recommend immediate indoctrination into foreign entity's Swarm.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00178=Never.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00179=What are you talking about?
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00180=Primal zerg. [Angry 60]Unacceptable.[/Angry] Must be wiped clean. No trace left. [Angry]Destroy[/Angry] primal zerg.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00181=Saw ranged primal zerg creatures on battlefield? Based on hydralisk!
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00182=Primal zerg[Angry] stole[/Angry] design from Swarm! Swarm on planet for hours, [Angry]days[/Angry], already being replicated!
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00183=Abathur, are you upset?
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00184=Unacceptable! Swarm's power, ability to assimilate strengths. Primal zerg [Angry]must not[/Angry] take from us!
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00185=Don't worry about it. They'll be [Serious]on our side[/Serious] before I am done here.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00186=Yes. [Surprise 70]What about it?[/Surprise]
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00187=Placed parasite into protoss host.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00188=Clever. Lateral thinking. Protoss not able to[Angry 70] be infested.[/Angry] But can still be host to foreign organism.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00189=I made it, Abathur. You're not the only one who can spin sequences.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00190=Origins of parasite unknown.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00191=Revelation. Will continue work.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00192=Yes. [Surprise 70]What about it?[/Surprise]
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00193=I made it, Abathur. You're not the only one who can spin sequences.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00194=Abathur, my special project continues. I have another sequence I wish you to spin.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00195=I don't think so. You see, before I share the second one with you, I'm going to wipe your memory of the first.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00196=Abathur, I wish you to spin a creature for me. Here is the first sequence.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00197=Just spin it.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00198=Also leads to increased independence. This contradicts imperative: zerg must present no danger to leader of Swarm.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00199=What is that sound?
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00200=Failed experiments. Reverting to biomass. Slow process.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00201=At least put them out of their misery first.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00202=At least put them out of their misery first.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00203=What is that sound?
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00204=Must take sample. Study new sequences.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00205=[Serious]Don't even try, Abathur.[/Serious] What I am now, is beyond your comprehension.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00210=Terran systems, inelegant. Problem with interchange. Many factors obstruct request. Biology, language.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00211=So our thoughts are too different for anything beyond simple transmissions.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00213=Accurate. Zerg processes complex. Incompatible with terran machinery.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00231=Then it's up to Valerian now.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00245=I need a weapon to destroy Korhal's orbital defenses and [Serious]I need it fast.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00248=Can modify virophage sequence. Would concentrate [Angry]bile, expel [/Angry]as projectile.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00249=Can you get it working in time?
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00250=Survival of Swarm dependent on evolution, iteration. Trust process, trust sequences. Swarm will not fail.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00252=Is it possible for the Swarm to hack into the Dominion's network?
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00259=Queen determines purpose. When purpose changes, Swarm changes.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00260=This, our function.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00261=You know, sometimes you're not so bad, Abathur.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00262=Unclear.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00263=Swarm has evolved into powerful weapon. Greatest leader.
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00264=[Surprise]Greatest?[/Surprise] [Serious]Abathur, everything I've done to the Swarm has been for my own revenge.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_EvolutionMaster/Line00265=I'll be the judge of that.

Conversation/zSM_PrimalZergAdvisor/Line00155=You're not impressed? The primal zerg never built anything this impressive.
Conversation/zSM_PrimalZergAdvisor/Line00156=We never would.
Conversation/zSM_PrimalZergAdvisor/Line00157=And you're proud of that? The ability to create tools is a sign of civilization. Even the Swarm uses living tools.

Conversation/zSM_PrimalZergAdvisor/Line00165=If that one lives, all essence will be collected. Change will stop. I will fight.
Conversation/zSM_PrimalZergAdvisor/Line00167=The terrans have no idea you're with me. [Serious]They don't know about the primal zerg.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_PrimalZergAdvisor/Line00168=We will collect them.
Conversation/zSM_PrimalZergAdvisor/Line00169=You will [Surprise 50]surprise them.[/Surprise] They have always used our psionic connection against us.
Conversation/zSM_PrimalZergAdvisor/Line00170=The primal zerg do not have this connection. The primal zerg do not need this.
Conversation/zSM_PrimalZergAdvisor/Line00171=Exactly.
Conversation/zSM_PrimalZergAdvisor/Line00172=I collect much essence from following.

Conversation/zSM_PrimalZergAdvisor/Line00177=[Surprise 50]You're not impressed?[/Surprise] The primal zerg couldn't build something like this.

Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00057=You're right, Zagara. [Happy 80]And there's no one I'd rather have as my second for this battle.[/Happy]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00058=I want her ready in time for the next battle.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00059=I want her ready in time for the next battle.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00060=I need her for the next battle.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00061=Perhaps she will never learn.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00062=I am puzzled. Why would you make me stronger after punishing me?
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00063=Wrong.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00064=What is most important?
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00065=Cunning!
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00066=Close. But still wrong.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00067=Ahh!
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00068=Close. But still wrong.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00069=Izsha, have Abathur revive Zagara again. And see if he can increase her mental flexibility.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00076=My understanding of vision must be incomplete.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00077=Why do you say that?
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00078=Because I see no strategic advantage to this location. There is no essence to absorb, no enemies to conquer.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00079=Yet I know that you possess vision, and your actions always have an underlying purpose.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00080=My reasons for being here are...[Sad 70] my own.[/Sad]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00081=It is your right to keep the truth from me, my queen. But I will try to find it anyway.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00082=Go ahead and try, Zagara. I'm pretty sure this one is outside your understanding.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00084=I look like the leader of the Swarm now. Perhaps this will help bring more broodmothers back into the fold.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00086=You were the true leader of the Swarm yesterday, and you will be tomorrow.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00088=Your appearance does not matter.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00089=Perhaps not to you. The terrans will not be so... [Serious]understanding.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00090=We came from this place?
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00091=The zerg first evolved here, yes.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00092=I do not like it. A soft world. Char is far superior.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00093=Don't be so sure. Zerus may prove [Serious]more dangerous[/Serious] than any world we've known.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00094=Let us return there and plot the destruction of the terrans.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00095=I have always wished to feel protoss bones snapping in my claws. May I?
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00096=No, Zagara.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00097=[Angry 80]Surely you do not think to show mercy?[/Angry]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00098=Violence is a tool. I use it when [Serious]I have to.[/Serious] But a leader uses [Serious]the right tool [/Serious]for the job.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00099=This is a terran way to think. The zerg do not use tools at all.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00100=To a leader, everything -- and everybody -- is a tool.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00101=You have said you wish revenge on the leader of the terrans. But there are no terrans on this moon.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00102=Nafash's brood has valuable adaptations. [Serious]I need them[/Serious] to strengthen the Swarm so that I can [Angry 70]take down Mengsk.[/Angry]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00103=Surely my brood alone could defeat his forces? Terrans are weak.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00104=Isn't that what you thought about me?
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00105=They are not like you. You are the heart of the Swarm.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00108=The infested terran... I have never seen his like. He is powerful, but closed off. Where is he from?
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00109=Stukov is from Earth. A few years ago, they sent an invading force here. [Serious]I remember it[/Serious]-- [Angry 65]I destroyed them.[/Angry]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00111=As it should be.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00112=I thought Stukov [Serious]was killed.[/Serious] I heard reports that he'd been resurrected. That he'd been[Surprise 60] infested, then cured.[/Surprise]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00113=If he's been a prisoner here all these years, [Serious]anything is possible.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00114=This place is very far out of the way, but it's guarded as if it were Korhal itself.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00115=The terrans must greatly prize that which lies within.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00116=I can't imagine how they built this structure in the upper atmosphere of Ketill.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00117=[Surprise 60]But technology at this scale[/Surprise]... This is beyond Mengsk's engineers.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00118=Perhaps they have help from something greater than themselves?
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00119=If there are any answers, [Serious]they are inside.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00122=This thing in the lab, [Serious]this Narud. [/Serious]It's shielding itself from me, but I can [Serious]still sense its power.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00123=But you destroyed the Ancient One. You captured the power of all Zerus.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00124=It's like... [Serious]nothing I've faced before.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00125=This is something [Serious]born of the void.[/Serious] Cold and empty. But [Serious]so powerful[/Serious] it hurts.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00128=Do you know why I beat you in battle?
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00129=You were stronger than I.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00130=[Serious]No.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00131=Faster then.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00132=[Serious]No.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00133=[Surprise 80]Do not toy with me, my queen![/Surprise] Tell me your secret!
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00134=This is not something I can explain. You must learn the hard way.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00135=Do you know why I beat you in battle?

Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00141=No, Zagara.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00142=Violence is a tool. I use it when [Serious]I have to.[/Serious] But a leader uses [Serious]the right tool [/Serious]for the job.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00143=To a leader, everything -- and everybody -- is a tool.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00144=Tell me of it.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00145=He will tell me?
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00146=[Serious]Talk to Abathur[/Serious] in the evolution pit.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00147=He will [Serious]change you. Go.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00148=I can't explain it to you. Perhaps you will understand in time.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00149=Your strategy against the terrans was strange. But I understand it now.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00150=[Happy 75]Abathur's changes are bearing fruit.[/Happy] Do you [Serious 75]remember[/Serious] what I told you on the battlefield?
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00151=Vision. Is this like cunning?
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00152=No.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00153=Viciousness?
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00154=Abathur. Go to him.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00155=His work is painful.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00156=[Serious]His work[/Serious] will make you understand vision.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00157=I will go.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00158=The terran is cornered.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00159=Cornered terrans are [Serious]the most dangerous kind.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00160=Dangerous or not, we will crush them.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00161=[Surprise 60]Respect your opponent, Zagara.[/Surprise] He has teeth you cannot see.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00162=The old Queen of Blades did not speak as you do.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00163=Times have changed. [Serious]Adapt.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00164=You have done it. Char is yours.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00165=[Serious]Char is ours.[/Serious] The Swarm is greater [Serious]than the sum of its parts.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00166=You speak so strangely. You say things that sound weak. [Surprise 70]Yet you continue to destroy your enemies.[/Surprise]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00167=There's a lesson for you there.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00168=I will serve you, my queen, and I will learn from you. Shall we conquer another world?
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00169=I can't explain it to you. Perhaps you will understand in time.
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00170=He will [Serious]change you. Go.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_RogueQueen/Line00171=[Serious]Talk to Abathur[/Serious] in the evolution pit.

Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00072=The fallen xel'naga. A being of unknowable power.
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00073=There's no way we can win.

Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00075=I am with you.
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00076=Well, I never wanted to die lying down. So, fight a god to the bitter end? That sounds like a worthy death.

Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00081=I did. We'll find out [Serious]very soon[/Serious] if I was a good student.

Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00119=They will come back someday, you know.
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00120=I do. And I will be ready for them.
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00121=This isn't just about getting rid of the hybrid threat, [Serious]is it? Why are you helping me?[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00122=They held me here for many years. I survived experiments, torture, and worse.

Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00126=Zerg and protoss DNA combined -- something that should not be possible.
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00128=Skygeirr Station. The Dominion's secret weapons lab. This is the heart of Mengsk's hybrid breeding program.
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00129=And these creatures will follow Mengsk's orders?
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00130=He believes they will. [Happy 80]I am not so sure.[/Happy]
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00133=I am surprised you did not rush off to rescue Jim Raynor.
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00134=Mengsk needs Jim alive and well to keep me away from Korhal. And we have to take down this lab.
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00137=Perhaps. Or perhaps you know how Raynor will react when you face him?
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00138=Keep your opinions to yourself, Stukov.
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00139=I wonder how Narud could hope to resurrect a being as powerful as Amon?
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00140=I think the hybrid are key. They gather psionic energy. [Serious]But where would they get enough to resurrect a dead god?[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00142=Maybe with enough psionic energy, he can bring back Amon?
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00143=You told me an ancient xel'naga artifact was used to make you human again.
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00144=But all the power you wielded as the Queen of Blades... where did it go after your transformation?
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00145=[Surprise]You mean... [/Surprise]there might have been hybrid nearby who gathered it? [Fear 75]And... used it to... [Fear]oh[/Fear] no.[/Fear]
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00146=If Narud used the xel'naga artifact in that way... he may already have enough energy to resurrect Amon.
Conversation/zSM_Stukov/Line00147=Then why fight?

Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00002=The hunt goes well, my queen?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00007=Of course. Forced adaptation.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00008=For zerg, it is. Whatever my queen has lost, think what she has gained:
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00009=Izsha. When the Queen of Blades... [Serious]when I commanded the Swarm here on Char.[/Serious] What was I like?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00010=You never told us. You only said that you had seen a vision of our extinction. And you wanted us to fight to the last.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00014=Adapt or die. It is our only choice.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00016=They went feral. They attacked each other. They died by the millions.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00019=The Swarm was once Amon's tool. He will seek to use us again.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00020=Izsha, all around me I see signs of the old Queen of Blades.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00022=But I can't remember why I held my forces here on Char for so long.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00023=You were studying the future, planning for a great war.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00024=[Surprise 75]What war?[/Surprise] [Serious]Explain.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00028=I don't know about that. But the zerg will never again be pawns of other races... [Serious]not even the xel'naga.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00032=Nafash was strengthening her brood, by putting them in the harshest environment she could find.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00034=There is so little life here for a brood to assimilate.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00040=I am the leader of the Swarm and if I die, so do all of you. Remember it.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00042=Purity of essence. You are the will of the Swarm.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00047=It's bloody.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00048=[Angry 80]Those protoss would kill you if they could.[/Angry] [Serious]They are not zerg, that means they are the enemy.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00049=You have become strong and taken another world. [Happy 70]I think you will conquer the universe.[/Happy]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00050=And now?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00053=Is it that simple?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00094=You dispersed the Swarm to search for the parts of a xel'naga artifact.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00113=But when the terrans came here with that same artifact, you recalled the nearest broods to defend you. 
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00168=We do not know where he is right now. We must prepare for his coming, but I have a few scores to settle first.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00169=Of course, my queen.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00170=My queen, the Swarm has assembled above Korhal. The broodmothers await your command.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00171=Tell them to hold position in orbit. Stay out of range of the planet's defenses.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00172=Dominion fleets are converging on our position. Terran troops are arriving from all over the sector.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00173=Nothing will stop us. Korhal is mine.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00175=Broodmother Kilysa, hear me. Have your leviathans form a blockade. Kill anything coming into the system.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00177=You were mighty. You made us cunning and strong, and we knew we would survive forever under you.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00181=[Happy 70]You radiate so much power.[/Happy] More than the old Queen of Blades ever did.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00184=Everything is different. I could always hear the Swarm, control it.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00186=But now... I feel the Swarm. Now I am the Swarm.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00188=He's gone. Whatever agenda he's pursuing... he's not a threat to me. [Serious 80]Not right now, at least.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00189=We have changed. And now, other worlds await.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00190=I cannot detect the dark templar. Is he hidden on the leviathan, waiting to strike?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00194=Isn't anything not zerg a threat to us?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00195=Do not question me, Izsha.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00196=As you say, my queen.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00197=There used to be billions of zerg here. What happened?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00198=I see. But what of the broods that were still out in deep space?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00199=That will not happen again.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00200=I want all the broods ready. We face Warfield, the best general the terrans have.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00201=Surely he is no match for you. You have conquered zerg and protoss alike.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00202=Don't underestimate the terrans. They defeated me once before.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00206=Char is ours, once again.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00208=Our enemies should fear us.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00209=We still have a long way to go.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00210=We are numberless, we are relentless, [Serious 50]and we are evolving.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00211=We are also done on Char. I will decide on our next destination soon.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00212=Tell me about this leviathan.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00213=I wonder why they are willing to give up their independence?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00214=It is a good sign that some of your broodmothers are returning to the fold.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00215=Perhaps not all of them wish to rule the Swarm.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00217=And perhaps they know there is safety in numbers.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00220=You can evolve and upgrade your Swarm in the evolution pit. The creature Abathur can help you.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00223=Of course, my queen. But our numbers are few.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00224=Before conquering other worlds, you may wish to reclaim your forces here on Char.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00225=Before conquering other worlds, you may wish to reclaim your forces here on Kaldir.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00226=And it can take me to any world I wish?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00230=It is one of the least hospitable places in the Koprulu Sector. Perhaps Nafash thought she could hide here.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00233=How can Zagara stand against you? Surely she has no chance.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00235=Zagara is different than the other broodmothers. [Serious]Tougher. Meaner.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00236=You sound as if you admire her.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00237=I know something about being cornered and deciding to fight anyway.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00238=She won't make it easy.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00239=Another world for the Swarm. The broods are coming back together.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00241=There is still much to do.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00242=We are also done on Char. I will decide on our next destination soon.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00244=Was it a mistake to come here? We risk much by bringing the protoss into our war against the terrans.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00245=I needed the essence of Nafash's brood. She evolved it to new heights of aggression. Conflict with the protoss was inevitable. 
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00247=I see.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00251=Our scouts report a large protoss ship on the other side of the moon.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00252=The interstellar ship they used to travel here. 
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00253=It is not yet ready for launch, but it will be before we can get to it.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00256=[Serious 80]They're tenacious, I'll give them that[/Serious]. But I am ready for this.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00257=The interstellar ship they used to travel here. 
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00259=[Serious 80]They're tenacious, I'll give them that[/Serious]. But I am ready for this.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00260=It is done. [Sad 50]The Golden Armada will never know we were here.[/Sad]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00261=I am glad that protoss is no longer aboard our leviathan. [Serious]Her psionic presence was disturbing.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00262=She died bravely, trying to save her friends.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00263=Why do you care how the protoss died?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00264=I will kill anyone in my way. That doesn't mean I enjoy it.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00265=Even Arcturus Mengsk, my queen? Will his death bring you no joy?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00266=Stop talking, Izsha.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00267=It is done. [Sad 50]The Golden Armada will never know we were here.[/Sad]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00268=She died bravely, trying to save her friends.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00269=I will kill anyone in my way. That doesn't mean I enjoy it.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00270=Be silent, Izsha.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00277=But the primals feed off the essence of individuals. They're in a state of constant evolution. [Surprise 70]They don't die.[/Surprise]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00278=Until they are killed by another primal.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00281=True. The most successful hunters among them must be incredibly ancient. [Serious]And incredibly dangerous.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00290=We have arrived in Dominion space. Are we finished with the Dominion secret lab?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00291=We have arrived in Dominion space. Should we move on Korhal?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00292=Not yet. I have to deal with something first.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00293=[Surprise 50]Will this give us some special advantage my queen?[/Surprise] Should Abathur be ready for new essence?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00294=[Serious]Silence, Izsha.[/Serious] This is a personal matter. It will end badly, but I must see it through.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00295=They were necessary to my plans.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00296=The broodmothers dislike working with terrans.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00298=Tell them the terrans are not to be harmed. It is my will.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00299=I will tell them, my queen.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00314=There were so many ways to fail, I feared we would not make it to the surface. But we did.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00316=I am one with the Swarm, Izsha. If we survive this fight, we have even greater battles ahead.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00345=Now nothing is clear, but the Swarm will continue. If you die, we will serve another leader.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00346=It is the organism from which you command the Swarm. And this is its nerve center.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00347=I'm looking through the eyes of my overlords. [Surprise 70]These primal zerg are fascinating. They show no signs of age.[/Surprise]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00349=All organisms age. Even zerg.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00380=I don't remember that... [Serious]at all.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00381=You have made us so powerful. [Fear 60]But when you have your revenge, will you leave us?[/Fear]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00383=We will face them together.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00384=[Happy 70]We've shattered the power of Mengsk.[/Happy] It will be up to the terrans to make something of the opportunity.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00385=Whatever comes, I am ready, my queen.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00386=Even if we fall and die in this battle, we've already done the impossible.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00387=That means nothing to the future of the Swarm.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00388=True, but there are still broodmothers in orbit with their leviathans. The Swarm will continue, [Serious]no matter what.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00389=And it will be changed forever.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00393=The force that you left here has kept the terrans penned inside their lab.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00394=We still control the main entrance, and your Swarm is ready to enter the breach at any time.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00395=So it's still under control. Good. I was worried that I... shouldn't have left.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00396=My queen? I don't understand, you are always right in all things.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00397=Izsha, you've never been so wrong before.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00398=We are sensing strange entities in the lab.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00399=You mean besides the hybrid and the evil shapeshifter?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00400=We are sensing protoss inside the lab, my queen. In great numbers.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00401=I saw some of them inside already. Tal'darim. They are unlike any protoss I know.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00402=They serve Amon willingly. [Surprise 70]They worship him.[/Surprise]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00403=They worship a dead god?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00404=That makes them even more dangerous.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00405=Contact the broodmothers. Tell them to bring their leviathans to this system.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00406=Should they unleash their broods upon the station?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00407=I want them nearby. [Serious 50]After we destroy this station, we're going to Korhal.[/Serious]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00408=No, Zagara and I will lead our broods in the assault.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00409=So the other broods will simply hold in orbit?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00410=They are asking if we may destroy the terrans now that they are no longer useful.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00411=[Angry 70]Leave the strategy to me.[/Angry] Now, what else can I do on this leviathan?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00412=The Ancient One is key to unlocking the power of Zerus, and I need that knowledge.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00413=My queen, why did we wake the Ancient One? Its power outstrips even yours.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00414=Will it not destroy us?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00415=It's called a gamble. It's something terrans do, when their instincts tell them the time is right.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00416=I see. Just as when the terran James Raynor came to Char to return you to your original form?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00417=[Sad 75]Yes, just like that.[/Sad] [Sad]The thing about gambles, Izsha, is that sometimes you lose.[/Sad]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00418=I needed the essence of Nafash's brood. She evolved it to new heights of aggression. Conflict with the protoss was inevitable. 
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00421=Protoss, my queen. In great numbers.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00423=One terran tells us another terran is alive, and he think this will influence the Swarm? How strange.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00424=Terrans are complicated. Don't spend too much energy trying to understand them.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00425=Yes, my queen.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00426=We have arrived in Dominion space. Should we move on the Dominion research facility?
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00427=The rest of the leviathan is devoted to transporting your Swarm.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00428=Yes, I sense them now. Tal'darim.
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00429=I will prepare for his coming... but not until I'm done with [Angry 80]Mengsk.[/Angry]
Conversation/zSM_ZergAdjutant/Line00430=I want them nearby. [Serious 50]After we destroy this station, we're going after Jim.[/Serious]

Conversation/zSM_ZerusAncientOne/Line00001=The primal zerg say the Swarm is corrupted. What did the fallen xel'naga, Amon, do to us?
Conversation/zSM_ZerusAncientOne/Line00002=He desired our strength, the ability to steal essence. But we were independent... We would not follow.
Conversation/zSM_ZerusAncientOne/Line00004=And so he bound the zerg to a single overriding will. They lost their identity, and became his slaves.
Conversation/zSM_ZerusAncientOne/Line00005=The hive mind. That's Amon's corruption?
Conversation/zSM_ZerusAncientOne/Line00006=It is, and a terrible fate for a strong primal zerg.
Conversation/zSM_ZerusAncientOne/Line00008=I hope it is so. For he truly could rip worlds apart.
Conversation/zSM_ZerusAncientOne/Line00015=He never controlled me. I felt... an influence. A trace of something dark, but long gone.
Conversation/zSM_ZerusAncientOne/Line00017=You have been reborn. A primal pack leader of boundless power.
Conversation/zSM_ZerusAncientOne/Line00018=I feel as if I can rip worlds apart.
Conversation/zSM_ZerusAncientOne/Line00019=And are you the equal of Amon, who once controlled you?
Conversation/zSM_ZerusAncientOne/Line00020=Amon must have died before I was infested.

Conversation/zScripted_EvoMissionsUnlock/Line00008=What kind of improvement?
Conversation/zScripted_EvoMissionsUnlock/Line00012=Answer complex. Can branch evolution of fully evolved zergling, form two new strains.

Conversation/zScripted_EvoMissionsUnlock/Line00016=Fine, make some of each; I want to see them in action.
Conversation/zScripted_EvoMissionsUnlock/Line00018=Will set up tests for both. Initiate test after fully evolving zerglings.

Conversation/zScripted_HybridArcBefore/Line00015=It is here that Mengsk breeds the hybrid -- combining protoss and zerg DNA to create monstrous creatures of immense power.
