Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00055=[Happy]那群白痴雇佣兵还在用秃鹫，你能相信吗？[/Happy]这种破玩意儿有时候比敌人的子弹更致命。 /// [Happy]Those goofy mercs are still using Vultures, can ya believe it? [/Happy]Damn things are death traps even when you ain't got people shooting at ya.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00056=注意言辞，斯旺。我的老秃鹫车救过我不知道多少回了。我不想听你侮辱这样一个工程杰作。 /// Careful now, Swann. My old Vulture saved my skin more times than I care to remember. I ain't gonna listen to you trash talk a classic piece of engineering like that.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00057=杰作？！可能是吧。因为对大多数人而言，只要自己的车没炸到自己，就算挡板冻住了或是辐射机油渗漏了，也算不了什么——对吧，谁在乎它是不是杰作呢？ /// Classic?! I suppose you could call 'em that. 'Course most folks like a bike that don't explode on them when the repeller seals freeze up, or the fuel cells start leaking radioactive waste - [Happy 70]but hey, who cares if it's a 'classic', right?[/Happy]

Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00060=我说斯旺，咱们怎么才能造出奥丁那样的东西来？ /// So Swann, what're the chances we can build something like that Odin?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00061=[Surprise 70]你疯了？[/Surprise]我们现有的设备生产不了那么大块头的东西。 /// [Surprise 70] You nuts? [/Surprise]No way we got the facilities for mass-producing hardware on that scale.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00062=我觉得你是无所不能的，斯旺。 /// And here I was thinking you could build anything, Swann.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00063=嘴真甜。好吧——交给我了！我会解决的，不用担心。而且我造出的东西肯定比那个样品实用一百倍。我们走着瞧！ /// Cute. Alright - forget the scale! I'm gonna figure it out, don't you worry. An' I'll come up with something a damn sight more practical than that show piece. You see if I don't!

Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00065=哥们，看到星灵舰船有多大了吗？每次我看到它们，它们的新玩意儿都能让我的下巴掉到脚面。明白我的意思？  /// Man, did ya see the size of that protoss ship? Don't matter how often I see 'em, those guys always come out with something that makes your jaw drop. Know what I'm sayin'?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00066=我更希望他们能把本事都用来消灭虫子。凯瑞甘是大家的敌人，这时候搞内耗真是太傻了。 /// I'd be more impressed if they were using all that power against the zerg. It's stupid to be killing protoss when we should be teaming up with them against Kerrigan.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00067=听着——他们活该，你的选择才是正确的。滥杀无辜的人不是我们的朋友，吉姆。你的挺身而出让我自豪。 /// Listen - they deserved it, and you did the right thing. Friends don't let friends massacre civilians, Jim. I'm proud of you for standing up to 'em.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00068=我们是不是该多救一些移民者？ /// Do you think we coulda saved more of those colonists? 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00069=说实话？不应该。除非你的脑袋被门挤了。 /// Honest? No. And you got your head up your ass if you think any different.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00070=一定有更好的办法。要是早点抓到它也许…… /// There had to be a better answer, though. Maybe if we caught it earlier...
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00071=嘿，如果连拥有高科技、超能力和外星大脑壳的星灵都束手无策的话——那我们就更无能为力了。人生有时就是那么残酷。 /// Look, if the protoss with all their tech, psionics and big freakin' alien brains couldn't do anything for them - there ain't nothing we coulda done. Sometimes life's just rough that way.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00076=有了攻城坦克，我们就能摆弄点大家伙了。 /// We're rockin' some serious heavy metal now that we got siege tanks.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00077=是长官……那悦耳的炮声。嗯，这要是敌人的炮声，那就难听了。 /// Yessir... the comforting thunder of the big guns. Well, comforting when they're on our side.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00078=没错，这些新坦克的移动火力更强，护甲也更坚固了。 /// Yeah these newer tanks have better guns when they're on the move, and reinforced armor.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00079=只要能保证攻城模式下的射程就够了，其它都不重要。前有攻城坦克后有地堡，我们将固若金汤。 /// So long as they've still got the range in siege mode, the rest is just gravy. Between siege tanks and bunkers, we can hold the line against just about anythin'.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00080=谢谢你的呵护。我这就去。 /// Thanks, mom. I'll get right on that.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00081=怎么了，牛仔先生，你脸色真难看。又想那姑娘了吗？ /// Oh what the hell, cowboy, you look like crap. You been thinking about that girl again?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00082=有点。我听说要是救不了她，那我们可就惨了。 /// Kinda. I just got some bad news 'bout what might happen if we can't save her.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00083=啊呸，要是我，就不会为没影儿的事瞎操心。需要帮忙就跟我说。 /// Bah, no use worrying about what might happen if you ask me. You want me to help, you just let me know. 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00087=[Surprise 70]有什么问题？[/Surprise] [Angry 70]说好了只是对付不共戴天的敌人！这群孩子的亲友们都被蒙斯克杀害了！[/Angry] [Sad 70]再这样，我们的队伍就要先从内部瓦解了。这你都不明白吗？[/Sad] /// [Surprise 70]What's the problem?[/Surprise] [Angry 70]You only signed us up with our mortal enemies!

Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00090=知道吗，我一直在研究日志。我们与星灵之间差距很大。他们的有些花样简直令人难以置信。 /// Y'know, I been watchin' the logs. Those damn protoss are still way ahead of us. I can't believe some of the stunts they can pull off.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00091=快和我说说！看来上一次交手后他们又学会新东西了。 /// Tell me about it! They've learned some new tricks since the last time we fought.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00092=我是说，他们什么时候能到处折跃部队了？我以为怎么也要有个传送门啊！ /// I mean c'mon, since when could they warp in guys just anywhere? I thought they needed some kinda gateway at least!
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00093=也不是任何地方，附近必须有水晶塔或其它能量源。不过，大家都一直在研究自己的东西。 /// Not just anywhere, they need a pylon or another power source close by. Still, they've been working to improve their tech just like us.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00094=现在不是讨论的时候，斯旺。我必须这么做。 /// (growls) It ain't up for discussion, Swann. I gotta do this.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00101=哈哈！我就说吧——我造出的东西比奥丁那块废铁强多了。 /// Ha! Y'see - told ya' I could build something better than that piece o' crap Odin.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00102=干得不错，兄弟！让他们知道谁才是强者！ /// I like that. That's the spirit, brother! Show 'em who's boss!
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00103=底盘还得再改改，可我还得考虑升级和变型，明白吗？这些可不便宜哦。这种拉风的大家伙很烧钱的。不过绝对物有所值。 /// Got some work to do on the chassis still, but I got to thinkin' about upgrades and variants, y'know? They ain't gonna be cheap, cowboy. Big honkin' thing like that never is. But they'll be worth it, you'll see.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00104=这话我爱听！让我来看看哪些我们用的起。 /// That's what I like to hear! I'll take a look and see what's affordable.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00106=你到底在实验室里捣鼓什么呢啊，牛仔先生？ /// What in hell's name did you stir up in that lab, cowboy?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00107=蒙斯克现在成了上帝了。他造出那东西后又复制了一大堆！鬼知道他还有多少实验室？ /// Mengsk's taken to playin' god literally now. He made that thing and whole heap more like it! An' who knows how many other labs he's got out there?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00114=真好，看来我们光对付虫子还不算完。现在蒙斯克也在培育他的臭怪兽了。 /// Great, like we ain't got enough to handle with the zerg. Now we got Mengsk breedin' his own damn monsters too.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00115=真是太棒了！有些小动物想要把两层甲板都吃了，四个引擎和一半的炮塔都无法工作！ /// Oh this is just great, cowboy! I've got critters tryin' to chew through two decks, four engines out and half the defensive turrets are offline!
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00116=你能让船撑下去吗，斯旺？ /// Can you keep her together, Swann?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00117=当然能！我最擅长这个了，兄弟！ /// Course I can! Havin' the time of my life, brother!
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00118=这儿就交给你了。我想办法对付那些喋喋不休的邻居。 /// Well you keep things workin' around here. I'll see what I can do about our rowdy neighbors.

Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00144=要是我研制新装备的时候能有图纸，那就更得心应手了。但这些都不是现成的，有时得靠求、借甚至是偷。 /// Sometimes we take a job with some kinda new hardware and I get a schematic for it so we can make more of 'em. The plans for other stuff we gotta either beg, borrow or steal.

Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00014=说出来你准不信，我刚在船上见到了泽拉图。 /// You ain't gonna believe this, but I just saw Zeratul on the ship.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00015=啊！你今晚又喝高了吗，长官？ /// Ah. How much did you have to drink tonight, sir?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00016=[Angry 70]我没喝多，马特。他受了伤，[/Angry] 好像在躲什么人。 /// [Angry 70]He was here, Matt. And he was hurt,[/Angry] on the run from something.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00018=[Fear 50]不知道。不过他已经走了。他给了我一个伊安记忆水晶，迫切地要我研究一下。 [/Fear]似乎他想让我看什么。 /// [Fear 50]I don't know. But he ain't on this ship anymore. He gave me an Ihan memory crystal and he was desperate for me to study it. [/Fear]I guess he wants me to see what he's seen.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00019=惊心动魄。那东西实在太邪恶了。 /// Hard to forget. That thing was an abomination.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00020=泽拉图把找到的预言碎片带到了……神庙？图书馆？反正就是那地方。那里已经被混合体占领了。[Fear 70]这种东西到底还有多少？[/Fear] /// Well Zeratul took the prophecy fragments he had to a... temple? Library? Kinda both I guess. A hybrid had already taken over the place. [Fear 70]Just how many of these things are out there?[/Fear]
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00021=我们不可能靠一艘旗舰和几个志愿者来阻止一场外星入侵。 /// There's no way we can stop an alien invasion with one capital ship and a handful of volunteers. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00022=你还好吗，长官？多年后与凯瑞甘再度相遇—— /// Are you alright, sir? Confronting Kerrigan again after all these years...
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00023=我们得阻止她……不管她在找什么。 /// We've gotta' stop her Matt... no matter what she's after.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00024=对，今天我们阻挠了她。那些神器对她显然非常重要，她在打什么主意？ /// Well, we gave her a setback today. The artifacts are obviously important to her, I just wish we knew why.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00031=我一直在找加密专家来破解我们找回的那个副官。还没有进展。 /// I've been looking for an encryption expert so we can access the adjutant we recovered. No luck so far.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00034=那么，马特，你准备再次进攻蒙斯克？ /// So, Matt, you planning another strike against Mengsk?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00036=亡者之港的奥尔兰上校是个破解高手……我也有段日子没回去了。[Happy 70]我说，上次在那儿你最后没把自己嫁了？[/Happy] /// Colonel Orlan at Deadman's Port can crack anything... Haven't been back there in awhile. [Happy 70]Say, didn't you end up gettin' married last time we were there?[/Happy]
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00037=我跟你说过了－如果我知道奖品，我才不会参加那个牌局呢！ /// I told you before - If I knew what the prize was, I never woulda' joined that card game!
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00038=只是看到爱侣的重聚让我有些伤感。 /// There's just something about a lovers' reunion that chokes me up.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00039=唉…… /// (sighs)
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00047=到底有多糟，马特？ /// Just how bad is it, Matt?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00048=虫群对全星区发起了进攻，长官。蒙斯克把舰队调去保卫帝国的核心世界，却任由边缘世界自生自灭。这真是噩梦。 /// Zerg are attacking all over the sector, sir. Mengsk pulled the fleet back to protect the Dominion core-worlds, leaving the fringe worlds to fend for themselves. It's a nightmare.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00049=咱们最好要冷静，伙计。咱们可以趁这个机会把莫比斯那笔大买卖做了， /// 'Best we just stay clear, partner. [Happy 70]We can earn ourselves a fortune working for Moebius while this whole thing blows over.[/Happy]
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00050=泽拉图在找寻与宇宙末日有关的更多线索——但这一次他去了艾尔。 /// Zeratul was looking for more clues about the end of the universe -- but this time he was on Aiur.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00052=你太天真了，囚犯——还想什么“买卖”，虫群的目的是要我们全部灭亡！ /// You don't get it, convict - this isn't gonna just 'blow over'! The zerg won't stop until we're all dead! 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00056=还没有，长官。我认为应该先集中对付虫群。否则即使推翻蒙斯克也是毫无意义的。 /// Not just yet, sir. I figured we need to focus on the zerg first. Overthrowing Mengsk won't mean anything if we can't beat them.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00057=的确。要是凯瑞甘把我们都杀了，那还谈什么自由。呃，先别管蒙斯克了。 /// True. Freedom ain't worth squat if Kerrigan kills us all, that's for sure. Guess Mengsk can wait. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00058=别急，马特——我们不会坐以待毙，但我们也没有万全的准备。我们要先赚钱打造自己的部队，这样才能改变局面。 /// Don't worry, Matt - we ain't sittin' this one out. But we're not exactly in tip top shape either. We'll earn some cash and build up our forces so we can make a difference when it counts.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00060=能救那些民众当然好，但还有几百万人也在等待救援。 /// It sure felt good rescuin' those folks, but there's millions more out there that need help too.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00061=情况怎么样，马特？ /// How we doin' up here, Matt?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00069=通常……我甚至不知道自己在干吗。天天都在瞎忙。 /// Most days... I don't even know what I'm doin' anymore. Just chasing my damn tail.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00070=不。我们一直在追随您。您的正义感激励我们不断前行。 /// No. We've followed your lead from the start. It's your sense of justice that's kept us on this road.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00071=马特，我对正义的热望早已殆尽。我打了一辈子仗；我杀过人，我曾让好人枉死——但我图的什么？ /// Matt, my interest in justice burned out a long time ago. I've spent my whole life fighting; I've killed, I've ordered good men to their deaths - and for what? 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00072=那是因为您给了我们信仰，长官。我永远不会放弃战斗。我发誓。 /// That's because you gave us something to believe in, sir. I'll never give up the fight. That's a promise.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00073=每当我们伸出援手，美好的未来就又近了一步。 /// Every time we help folks in need it's another step on the road to a better future.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00074=很高兴见到您，长官。所有可用任务都在星图上，等您审阅。 /// Good to see you, sir. All available missions are ready for your perusal on the star map.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00075=马特……我……见鬼，谢了。 /// Matt... I. Hell, just thanks, I guess.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00078=欢迎回来，长官。这次使用水晶有什么发现？ /// Welcome back, sir. What did you discover from the crystal this time?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00082=明白，长官。我不会让您失望。 /// I know, sir. I won't let you down. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00083=马特，失败……反正一样是死。 /// Matt, If I fail... we're all dead men anyway. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00084=答案很简单，马特。我绝不会放弃她。就算希望渺茫，我都要坚持下去。 /// (beat) It's real simple for me, Matt. I'll never give up on her. Long as there's a chance of bringin' her back, I'll never quit.  
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00085=我的夙愿……是和蒙斯克做个了结。硝烟散去后要靠你们去创造更美好的未来。 /// (beat) Finishing this thing with Mengsk... it's all I have left. It's guys like you that'll build something better after all the smoke clears.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00086=长官，我不得不质疑这次结盟的客观性。这显然是一个陷阱！ /// Sir, I have to question your objectivity on this alliance. It's obviously a trap!
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00090=我会处理的，马特。我要你相信我。 /// I got it covered, Matt. I'm askin' you to trust me.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00092=你既然是我的人就要服从我！如果你再违抗我的命令就给我滚！ /// You signed up to follow my orders! If you can't do that anymore then get the hell off my ship! 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00093=好兄弟，停战只是暂时－－只是为了争取时间。 /// Good man. This truce won't last forever - just long enough to get the job done.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00094=可万一失败呢？你能受得住吗？ /// But what if you fail? Can you live with that? 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00095=[Sad 50]蒙斯克虽然是个无情的独裁者……但也不该迁怒于他的儿子。[/Sad]我跟随您出生入死，长官——我不会背弃您。 /// [Sad 50]Mengsk turned out to be a ruthless dictator... but that shouldn't automatically condemn his son. [/Sad]I've followed you through hell and back, sir - I'm not quitting on you now.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00096=和瓦伦里安的合作还让你耿耿于怀？ /// You still got a problem with us working alongside Valerian?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00097=我在实验室里待了多久，马特？ /// How long was I down in the lab, Matt?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00098=好几个小时了，长官。你一直待在实验室吗？ /// You've been gone for hours, sir. You've been in the lab all that time?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00099=我用了泽拉图给我的水晶。那景象虽然很短……但如此真实……泽拉图一直在找寻一个和宇宙末日有关的萨尔纳加预言。还有更多，我还没领会。 /// I used the Ihan crystal Zeratul gave me. I'd swear it only lasted a few minutes... So vivid... Zeratul's been searching for a Xel'Naga prophecy about the end of the universe. There's more, I just haven't got to it yet.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00100=马特，失败……反正一样是死。 /// Matt, If I fail... we're all dead men anyway. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00101=由于平台被摧毁，虫群已经停手。我们终于获得了高轨道的控制权。 但是长官——这最后一步——你真的知道你在干什么吗？万一救不了她呢？你真的考虑过吗？ /// With the platform down the zerg have stopped hammering us. We're finally gaining control of high orbit. [Fear 70]But, sir - this last step  are you sure you know what you're getting into? What if she can't be saved? Have you really considered that?[/Fear]
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00102=我不是来干这个的。 /// I didn't sign up for this.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00103=一眼就看出我用过，是吧？泽拉图把找到的预言碎片带到了……神庙？图书馆？反正就是那地方。那里已经被星灵与异虫的混合体占领了。 /// It's that obvious I used it, huh? Zeratul took the prophecy fragments he found to a... temple? Library? Kinda both, I guess. But this weird protoss-zerg hybrid had taken over the place. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00104=你指的是被感染的星灵？ /// You mean some sort of infested protoss?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00105=不，这根本不是感染。像是有人把这两个种族的力量融合在了一起。我跟你说，这要是真的，那我们就惨了。 /// No, this wasn't like infestation at all. It was like someone took the strengths of both races and twisted them together. I gotta tell you - if these things are real, we're in a lot of trouble.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00106=该死，马特。我弄不明白最后从水晶中看到的景象。 /// Damn, Matt. I don't even know what to make of this last vision from the crystal.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00107=艾尔？他在找什么？ /// Aiur? What was he looking for?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00108=泽拉图，他仍在艾尔，他想弄明白起初主宰为什么创造了刀锋女王。 /// He was trying to find out why the Overmind made the Queen of Blades in the first place.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00109=是为了要她毁灭整个宇宙？ /// She's the one that's going to destroy the universe?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00110=不，恰好相反——我想只有她才能拯救宇宙。 /// No, that's just it - I think she's the only one that can save it.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00111=您好像很惊慌，长官。怎么了？ /// You look shaken, sir. What's wrong?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00112=泽拉图说这是未来的映像。我看是末日，马特。末日决战。星灵的部队庞大的超乎想象，但仍无法阻止混合体。 /// Zeratul called it a vision of the future. It was the end times, Matt. Armageddon. More protoss than we ever knew existed, but there still weren't enough to stop the hybrid.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00113=可是凯瑞甘呢？她不该来阻止它们吗？ /// But what about Kerrigan? Wasn't she supposed to stop them?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00114=那时候的她已经死了。我们……杀了她。泽拉图一直想说的就是这个……如果她死了，我们都将灭亡。 /// In this time-line she was dead. Killed by...us. That's what Zeratul's been trying to tell us all along. She has to live or we're all doomed.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00115=长官。 /// Sir.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00116=对抗蒙斯克的斗争刚有点实质性的进展。要是现在调转枪口，之前的努力就白费了！ /// We were starting to make real progress against Mengsk. If we go after the Queen of Blades, we're throwing that away!
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00117=一团糟，长官。我们的轨道位置快失守了。虫群的空军搞得我们精疲力尽，沃菲尔德的军队也要守不住降落区了。 /// It's a mess, sir. We're barely holding our orbital positions. Zerg fliers are pounding the hell out of us and Warfield's force is barely holding the landing zone. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00118=我知道你在尽力而为。坚持住，我们一定能挺过去。 /// I know you're doing the best you can. Just keep things together and we'll make it through this. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00119=马特，如果能在查尔取胜，数十亿的生命就会得救，数十亿啊！ /// This is bigger than Mengsk. Matt, if we succeed on Char, we'll save billions of lives. Billions.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00120=我知道铲除那些虫道让你们陷入了困境……非常抱歉。 /// I know taking out those Nydus canals left y'all in the lurch up here... I'm sorry for that. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00121=你做了你该做的，长官。[Fear 70]可最后一步——你真知道你在干什么吗？万一救不了她呢？你考虑过这个问题吗？[/Fear] /// You did what you had to do, sir. [Fear 70]But this last step - are you sure you know what you're getting into? What if she can't be saved? Have you really considered that?  [/Fear]
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00122=答案很简单，马特。我绝不会放弃她。就算希望渺茫，我都要坚持下去。 /// (beat)It's real simple for me, Matt. I'll never give up on her. Long as there's a chance of bringin' her back, I'll never quit.  
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00123=可万一失败呢？你能受得住吗？ /// But what if you fail? Can you live with that? 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00124=情况怎么样，马特？ /// How are things looking, Matt?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00125=长官，泰凯斯回到船上后，我派人对他进行了全身扫描。 /// Sir, when Tychus came back aboard the ship, I had the techs run a scan on him.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00126=马特，你得找个爱好。 /// Matt, you need to get a hobby.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00127=我是认真的，长官——他的护甲里有个精密的收发器……如果收到正确的代码，就会使他的主要器官停止工作。这太危险了。 /// Seriously Sir -- his suit contains a sophisticated transponder... if it receives the correct code, it'll shut down all his major organs. That suit is a death trap.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00128=这简直是个定时炸弹。 /// (stunned) He's got a gun to his head.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00129=照我说，您教训泰凯斯教训的对。他就是欠揍。 /// On a personal note, nice job with Tychus. That ass-kicking's been a long time coming.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00131=实现你那美好的未来得加把劲了，要不没人看得到了。 /// Your better future needs to hurry up an' get here or there's gonna be no one left to see it.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00132=又是谁在幕后控制呢？莫比斯？ /// And who's got their finger on the trigger? Moebius?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00133=泰凯斯，你都干了些什么！ /// Tychus, what have you gotten yourself into?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00134=他现在在哪儿，长官？ /// Where is he now, sir?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00135=我的恩怨不算什么。 /// Mengsk can wait.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00136=我觉得这个不太一样。文件说他们在密谋解决所有曾经在那里工作的人。 /// I think this one might be different. The files suggest they were planning to terminate everyone who ever worked there.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00137=我觉得这不是解雇……但蒙斯克为什么要杀死整个研究队呢？ /// I assume that doesn't mean 'firing' them... But why would Mengsk wanna' kill a whole research staff?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00138=我不知道，也许这就是我们应该弄清楚的。 /// I don't know, but it seems like something we should check out.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00139=嗯，的确。 /// It does, indeed.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00140=关于那条加密信息，你怎么看？ /// What do you make of that encrypted message,  Matt?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00141=这我可真不知道，长官。如果托什真是他们的一员，蒙斯克显然会设法破坏这次合作。但托什好像有所保留。想要赢得这场革命…… /// I honestly don't know, Sir. If Tosh really is one of these Spectres, it's clear Mengsk would try to ruin your partnership. But Tosh isn't telling us everything. If we're going to win this revolution...
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00142=我明白……一定得分清敌友。 /// I know... we have to be sure of our allies.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00143=如果海文星球上有汉森博士的人被感染了…… /// If any of Dr. Hanson's people on Haven are infested...
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00144=我知道——星灵来找他们只是时间问题。不过，我和他们有点儿交情。万不得已，我会去说服他们。 /// I know -- it's just a matter of time before the protoss come looking for them. (beat) Still, I have a history with the protoss. If it comes to that, maybe I can talk 'em down.

Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00038=你确定吗？蒙斯克一直在追杀你。没等你弄明白可能你已经被干掉了。 /// You sure about this? You gotta know Mengsk is gunnin' for ya. He'll hit you in a way you'll never see coming.

Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00078=把你的猜测给我烂在肚子里。要是再胡说，我就把你顺窗户扔出去。 /// Whatever you think you know, you just keep it to yourself. I hear you yappin' about this and I'll toss you out the airlock! 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00094=很高兴见到你，老兄。我一直 —— 在等你。从你的眼中我能看到。你所看到的灵魂世界……那个星灵。他给了你……一块水晶！你看到了他所目睹的一切。 /// Good to see ya', brotha'. I been - wait. I can see it in your eyes. You've seen into the spirit world... The protoss. He gave you ... a crystal! And now you've been seein' what he's seen.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00095=这关你什么事，托什！别来烦我。 /// That ain't nothing to do with you. Stay outta my head, Tosh!
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00096=我听你的。不过面对未来你要步步为营。如果要帮忙，尽管来找我。 /// Have it your way. But you want to tread careful when you go lookin' into the beyond. If you need me, you know where I be.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00099=你有点儿惊慌，你看到的是那个星灵想让你了解的东西，那回忆像白昼一样清晰。 /// You look spooked. You've been seein' what the protoss has to show you. The memories shine through you as clear as day.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00101=一定是制造它们的人。那只是黑暗降临的先兆之一。很快它们就要接踵而来 —— 整个星系将会随之呜咽。 /// The one that made them, for sure. That was just the first of many. Dark harbingers, man. Soon they'll be beyond numbering - an' the stars will weep at what comes after.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00102=你是从哪儿听来的？ /// How could you know all this?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00103=不是听来的，那只是我的感觉。 /// I don't. I just feel it be true. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00104=这次你看到的是什么，伙计？等等……我也看到了。凯瑞甘？ /// (amused) What've you been seein' this time, man? (sober) Wait...I see it too. Kerrigan?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00110=见鬼，哥们——我看你应该去喝一杯。 /// Damn, brotha' - you look like you could use a drink.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00111=我看到了泽拉图存在水晶中的影像。那是未来的一幕 —— 一场与混合体的决战。末日决战。但是……凯瑞甘却是阻止他的关键。 /// I saw the last vision Zeratul put into the crystal. It was a look into the future - a final battle against the hybrid. Armageddon. Somehow... Kerrigan's the key to preventing it.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00112=谁能知道命运的方向？轮回之后又是轮回。但我知道 —— 了解未来的人必须小心。那既是福……也是祸。 /// Who knows how the wheel turns? Cycles upon cycles. This much I know - Those that see the future best take heed. It's both a gift... and a curse. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00115=这就是他在收集神器的原因！ /// So that's why he's collecting up artifacts!
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00116=可能。这或许也是凯瑞甘收集神器的原因。她不一定想占为己有，但绝不会让其他人染指。 /// Maybe. Could be why Kerrigan's chasing them too. She may not want them for herself, but she'll stop anyone else from getting to them.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00117=听我的劝告——简单至上。不要有包袱，不要受干扰。心中只有自己。 /// Take my advice - keep it simple. No attachments, no strings. Just you against the universe.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00126=奇怪，为什么蒙斯克不直接派幽灵来干掉你？你可一直是他的心腹大患。 /// Ever wonder why Mengsk don't just send him Ghosts to kill you? You've been a thorn in his side for a long time.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00127=暗杀只能使我荣升为烈士。那就没办法抹掉我的影响。他想要我身败名裂。 /// Assassinating me'd just turn me into a martyr. (chuckles) He'd never be rid of me then. He needs to kill my reputation first. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00128=非常好。仇恨并没有让你失去冷静。不过他的耐心也是有限的。小心，雷诺先生。直觉告诉我，这艘船上有蒙斯克安插的内鬼。 /// Very good. You think clearly despite your hate for him. 'Course his patience has got limits too. Tread careful, Mr. Raynor. Someone on this ship is already working for Mengsk. I can feel it. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00132=你在下面发现的东西让我胆寒。那到底是什么？ /// Whatever you found down there makes me afraid. What was it?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00133=巨大的怪物——异虫和星灵的混合体。它强大的灵能会让它的咆哮在你耳中一路轰鸣。 /// Something monstrous - a zerg-protoss hybrid. It must've been a powerful psi for you to feel its scream from all the way up here. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00134=灼热、刺眼。就像太阳光照在脸上，强烈的连眼睛都睁不开。这是我第一次有这种感觉，我不想再有第二次了。 /// Searing. Blinding. Like feelin' the sun burning your face with your eyes squeezed shut. I never felt a thing like that before. I hope I never do again.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00135=刀锋女王的再度出现，让你百感交集了吧。 /// Must be hard, man, seeing the Queen o' blades out in the world again. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00136=你对凯瑞甘了解多少，托什？ /// How much do you know about Kerrigan, Tosh?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00137=我在幽灵军校有些……朋友。那姑娘在她神秘消失前一直是个传奇人物。没人知道真相……他们不知道刀锋女王是谁。 /// I had some... friends in the Ghost Academy. That girl was a legend even before she disappeared from the program. There's a few that know the truth... how the Queen of Blades came to be. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00138=她如今心中充满仇恨。 /// She's a creature of pure rage now.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00139=没错——结局只有一个。不是她死就是我们死。 /// Oh yes - it's her or us. If we don't kill her she'll slaughter us all.

Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00046=呵呵。那个女孩是个麻烦，泰凯斯。她正忙着全力追捕托什的残余部队。咱们最好别碍她的事。 /// Heh. That girl's nothin' but trouble, Tychus. She's got her hands full hunting down the rest of Tosh's psychopathic Spectres. Best just to stay out of her way.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00047=真是白问了。大好的机会啊…………伙计，你的确有很大的问题。 /// That wasn't no answer. All these missed opportunities... There's something very wrong with you, man.

Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00051=也对。我们这群坏蛋不适合安静的生活。命运把我们推上了更大的舞台。 /// Huh. Couple of badasses like us ain't cut out for the quiet life anyway. Yes sir, destiny's got us pegged for something way bigger.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00053=跟你说个事 —— 托什已经正式加入了我们的革命小队。他的幽魂部队会帮我们。 /// Thought you'd want to hear - Tosh has officially thrown in with our little revolution. He's gonna lend us his Spectres to help out.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00054=看来你抓住他们的弱点了，吉米。不看住这些疯子可不行。蒙斯克不会平白无辜关押他们。 /// You sure got a soft spot for wayward psychics, Jimmy. Settin' those freaks loose ain't smart. Ol' Mengsk had 'em locked up for a reason.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00055=蒙斯克把他们当作杀人的武器。他们有权为挣脱牢笼，为自由而奋斗……大家都一样。 /// Mengsk locked 'em up because they were just weapons to him. They deserve a shot at livin' their lives outside of a cage... just like anyone else.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00058=你是不是要说“早跟你说过了”——说我压根就不该去阿格瑞亚？ /// You gonna tell me 'I told ya so' - that we never shoulda gone to Agria in the first place?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00059=我不想哪壶不开提哪壶。就算不走运吧。另外你那些星灵朋友们肯定都为你自豪。 /// I ain't about to kick dirt on ya when yer down. Just some bad luck is all. Besides I'm sure your protoss buddies are real proud of you.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00060=这是我们自己的事儿。我才不管星灵们怎么想。 /// It was our own mess to clean up. I don't give a damn what the protoss think.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00063=我觉得你不过是想赚一笔，泰凯斯。 /// I thought it was just about the money with you, Tychus.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00067=你是怎么跟那些星什么灵交上朋友的？我听说它们可是见人就杀！ /// How'd you become such good buddies with those freaky pro-toss? All I hear is they kill terrans like you and me on sight!
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00068=有些星灵是那样的。但还有些愿意为保护人类而战死。 /// Some of 'em would. But some others would fight to the death protectin' people like us. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00071=我曾经在第一次战争中帮助他们抵抗虫子的入侵。在凯瑞甘回归之后，我又帮过他们一次。他们非常忠诚。 /// I helped 'em defend their homeworld from the zerg during the first war. When Kerrigan came back leading the Swarm, I helped 'em out again. They're real big on loyalty.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00073=我靠吉米，你好像还挺尊敬他们。 /// Damn Jimmy, almost sounds like you respect 'em. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00074=我没指望你能理解我，泰凯斯。 /// I wouldn't expect you to understand, Tychus. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00075=似乎我们越是靠近你的刀锋女王……嗯，只能说人算不如天算，吉米。 /// 'Just seems the closer we get to your Queen of Blades... well, let's just say things don't always work out the way ya' plan, Jimmy.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00079=这次我需要你帮我一把。看在多年的交情上……相信我。 /// I need ya with me on this one, Tychus. Trust me... for old times' sake.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00080=好吧，好吧，我帮你。 /// Alright. Alright, I'm with ya.

Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00085=估计他们现在忙死了。虫子就要入侵泰拉多尔了，莫比斯主研究中心就在那里。在他们安全转移前应该不会有消息了。 /// They got their hands full right now. The zerg are about to invade Tyrador where Moebius' main research center is. I don't reckon we'll hear anything from them until they relocate somewhere safe.

Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00089=如果不救那些学究，就永远别想知道为什么了。把数据上传到星图上。看来这又是一个经典的救援任务。 /// If those eggheads can't hold out till we get there, we may never know. Upload the data to the star map. Looks like we've got ourselves a good ol' fashioned rescue mission.

Conversation/Debriefs/Line00039=恐惧和暴力总能让我发挥最佳状态。 /// Well, fear and violence always did bring out the best in me.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00040=我得承认，我们是最佳组合。 /// Have to admit, we always did make a good team.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00041=对 —— 但那是在我进了大狱……你去当官以前。 /// Yeah, well - that was until I went to prison... and you went legit.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00042=对。 /// Right.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00043=什么？安提加的联邦已经够腐败了，但现在你却要用虫子来对付整个行星？你疯了。 /// What? The Confederates on Antiga were bad enough, but now you're going to use the zerg against an entire planet? This is insane.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00044=她说的没错。好好想想。 /// She's right, man. Think this through. 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00045=我已经想好了，相信我。听到命令了吗？去执行吧。 /// I have thought it through, believe me. You all have your orders. Carry them out.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00046=没人能阻拦我。联邦不能，星灵不能，任何人都不能！我会统治这片星区，或是看它化为一片焦土。 /// I will not be stopped. Not by you or the Confederates or the protoss or anyone! I will rule this sector or see it burnt to ashes around me.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00047=天哪！这是真的吗？这下蒙斯克要遗臭万年了！ /// Holy... I can't believe it! We can nail Mengsk to the wall with this!
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00049=说话，你这块废铁。你都知道什么？ /// Talk to me, you old piece of junk. What do you know?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00050=用户已识别。詹姆斯，雷诺，玛·萨拉移民地。前警长。已加入。克哈之子恐怖组织。身份。罪犯。 /// User identified. Raynor. James. Ex-marshal, Mar Sara colony. Joined. Sons of Korhal terrorist group. Status. Criminal.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00051=别再提我了，亲爱的。你这颗人造脑袋里还藏着什么东西？ /// Enough about me, darlin'. What else you got locked up in that synthetic head of yours?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00052=用户身份。罪犯。访问被拒绝。 /// User status. Criminal. Access denied.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00053=没那么简单，哈？我们会有办法的。 /// Playin' hard to get, huh? We'll see about that. 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00054=进攻查尔简直就是自杀！你拿所有人的生命冒险，就为了救回你的心上人！ /// Assaulting Char is a suicide mission! You'd be putting all our lives on the line just to get your girlfriend back!
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00055=这比我们加起来都重要，马特！我不是徇私。这是我们唯一的机会了。我绝不能错过。 /// This is bigger than all of us, Matt!  It ain't about me. This is the only real chance we're ever gonna' get. And I'm takin' it.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00056=那你要怎么做呢，吉米？是要带凯瑞甘回来……还是就地结果了她？ /// So which is it gonna be, Jimmy? We bringin' Kerrigan back... or puttin' her in the ground?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00057=交给我来决定吧。你还有许多准备工作——赶快去吧！ /// That's for me to decide. (beat) You've both got a lot of prep work to do -- get to it!
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00058=恕我冒昧，长官——但那个罪犯为什么还待在我的船上？ /// I hate to ask, sir -- but is there a reason that convict's still on my bridge?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00059=没事，马特。泰凯斯是我的故友。他……几年前拉过我一把。我欠他的。 /// Easy, Matt. Tychus is one of my oldest friends. He helped me out of a real bind a few years back. I owe him.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00060=好吧，他的犯罪记录长的简直…… /// Well your friend has a criminal record as long as...
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00061=和我一样？相信我，如果他要我死，我还能站在这儿？ /// Mine? Believe me, if Tychus Findlay wanted me dead, I'd be dead already.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00062=明白了，长官。 /// (Not liking it) Understood, sir.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00063=我撞见泰凯斯侵入我们的数据库，偷看有关凯瑞甘的资料。他在搞什么我不知道，但显然他不值得相信。 /// I caught Tychus hacking into our database, sniffing around about Kerrigan. I don't know what his game is, but we clearly can't trust him.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00064=马特，我认识泰凯斯很久了——这么多年来在一起摸爬滚打。他落网之后，帮我全扛了，没出卖过我。我逃过一劫，他却进去了。 /// Matt, me an' Tychus ran together a long time -- got into all sorts of trouble. When the law finally caught up, he took the rap for both of us. Never once ratted me out. (beat) I got a second chance, he got locked up.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00065=您是个重情义的人，长官，但—— /// I understand your loyalty, sir, but ---
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00066=我欠他的，马特。你别管了。 /// I owe him, Matt. Leave it be.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00067=是，长官。 /// Yes Sir.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00068=是，长官。 /// Yes sir.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00069=长官，找回来的那个副官就在实验室里。她已充能完毕。 /// Sir, that adjutant we recovered is down in the lab. She's all powered up.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00070=长官，副官已破解，您随时可以去实验室查看。 /// Sir, the decrypted adjutant is back in the lab, and ready to go.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00071=诺娃把幽灵训练方案传给我们了。现在可以训练我们的幽灵部队了。 /// Nova transmitted the Ghost training specs to us sir. We should be able to field our own Ghosts now.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00072=要是被蒙斯克发现，她有得解释了。 /// If Mengsk finds out, she's gonna have some explainin' to do.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00073=我觉得她能做到天衣无缝。这是幽灵的天赋，对吧？ /// I think she can cover her tracks. That's what Ghosts do, right?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00074=恩，还有暗杀。 /// That, and cut people's throats.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00075=没错。 /// Right.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00076=雷诺，朋友，你要为真理……做出见证。虚空中有个万恶的存在，它要将我们生命中的一切美好摧毁。这个……堕落者会是萨尔纳加吗？曾经的造物主……难道要将我们毁灭？ /// Friend Raynor, you now bear witness... to the truth. There is a malevolent presence within the Void that seeks to destroy everything we hold dear. Could this... Fallen One be a Xel'Naga? After so long... could the gods themselves seek our destruction?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00077=至于凯瑞甘……真难以置信——拯救万物于毁灭的居然是那个凶残的刀锋女王…… /// And Kerrigan... I can hardly believe -- the wretched Queen of Blades will prevent the destruction of all that we know...
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00078=雷诺，你很快将掌握凯瑞甘的命运。我只知道——她必须活着。千万小心，老朋友……虚空的猎犬……已经出笼。 /// Raynor, you may soon hold Kerrigan's fate in your hands. I know only that she must live. Be wary, old friend... the hounds of the Void... are on the hunt.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00079=没错。我们被称为幽魂——新一代的幽灵特工。 /// It's true. We are called Spectres -- next generation Ghosts.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00080=谁能没点秘密呢，雷诺先生。但这不代表我是你的敌人。 /// We all have our secrets, Mr. Raynor.  Doesn't mean I'm any threat to you.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00081=[Angry 50]未必——但不管是谁发来了这条信息。[/Angry]马特，有办法查到来源吗？ /// [Angry 50]Maybe not -- but whoever sent this message could be.[/Angry] Matt, any way to verify the transmission?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00082=暂时不能。但结尾说“我很快会再联系你。” /// No sir. But it does end with "I'll be in touch soon."
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00083=是蒙斯克——他想挑拨我们的关系。别上当。 /// It's Mengsk - trying to turn us against each other. Don't let him.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00084=先这么着吧——等找到发送人再说。但我会留意你的，托什。 /// I'll let it lie for now -- at least 'til I find out who sent this transmission. But I'll be keeping an eye on you, Tosh.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00085=找到适合你们居住的星球了吗？ /// Well Ariel, found a world for your people yet?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00086=找到了！一个叫海文的无主星球。靠近星灵领地边缘，但看上去很安全。 /// Yes! An unclaimed planet called Haven. It's near the edge of protoss space, but it seems safe enough.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00087=安全是必须的。你的人民是该好好休息了。 /// It'll have to do. Your people need to lay low for a while.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00088=你们都不担心那些人可能被感染吗？ /// Aren't either of you worried the colonists might be infested?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00089=随便你。 /// You can try.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00090=你怎么能这么说？他们每个人都非常健康！ /// How could you even suggest that? They're perfectly healthy!
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00091=但愿吧，艾蕊尔。只要是与感染沾边儿的事，星灵们就决不手软。以防万一，你该研究一下治愈这种病毒的药了。 /// I hope so, Ariel. The protoss don't mess around when it comes to infestation. Just in case, maybe you should start looking into some kind of cure for the zerg virus.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00092=通常来说，治愈是不可能的——病毒变异的太快了。但我不会放弃。 /// Conventional wisdom says a cure is impossible -- the virus mutates too fast. But I'll look into it.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00093=但尽人事，各凭天命吧。 /// Just do what you can. That's all anyone's askin'.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00094=那下面的东西……很像袭击泽拉图的那种怪物！ /// That thing down there, it was like the hybrid Zeratul fought.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00095=在这儿？但怎么会？ /// Here? But how?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00096=蒙斯克！又是蒙斯克！宇宙这下要完蛋了，我早该知道这一定是他干的！ /// (ranting) Mengsk! It's always Mengsk! The end of the universe is coming and I should have known he'd be behind it! 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00097=但他是怎么把异虫和星灵合二为一的呢？人类的科技目前还达不到这样的高度。他肯定得到了什么支持…… /// But how did he hybridize zerg and protoss? The technology required is way beyond anything terrans have developed. He can't be working alone on this...
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00098=蒙斯克到底在搞什么？ /// What the hell is Mengsk playing at?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00099=看来他是在打造自己的外星超级战士。他似乎找到了融合异虫和星灵的办法。 /// Creating his own alien super-soldiers by the looks of it. He's found a way to hybridize zerg and protoss somehow.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00100=好像他还没成气候。至少这实验室是完蛋了。 /// Don't look like he's house-broken 'em yet. Least the lab's been trashed.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00101=是的，但这不过是其中一个而已。谁知道还有多少个？ /// Yeah, but it was only one lab. Who's to say how many more he's set up?

Conversation/InstallerText/Line00002=与地球失去联系的幸存者们在星区内建立了若干个移民地。最大的移民地，塔桑尼斯，由强大却日渐专制的联邦政府建立。 /// Cut off from Earth, the survivors established colonies throughout the sector. The largest, Tarsonis, was founded by a powerful yet increasingly oppressive government called the Confederacy.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00003=面对政府骇人听闻的种种暴行，阿克图尔斯·蒙斯克成立了名为“克哈之子”的起义军组织。他们将推翻联邦政府、解放星区视为己任。 /// Spurred by the terrible acts of this government, Arcturus Mengsk formed the Sons of Korhal. This rebel army fought to overthrow the Confederacy and liberate the Koprulu sector.

Conversation/InstallerText/Line00005=大批外星战舰将联邦星球乔·萨拉团团包围。这群自称星灵的外星生物将乔·萨拉星球表面一切焚毁殆尽，之后神秘撤离。 /// Without warning, massive alien warships appeared and surrounded the Confederate planet of Chau Sara. Calling themselves protoss, the aliens incinerated the planet's surface and then mysteriously withdrew.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00006=星球被一种名为异虫的恐怖外星生物所感染，它们威胁要吞噬人类的领区，但星灵却要在异虫得逞前将其根除。 /// The planet had been infested by another type of alien: the zerg. These monstrous creatures threatened to overwhelm terran space, and the protoss sought to eradicate them before they spread.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00007=异虫已经抵达了玛·萨拉，联邦政府任由当地住民自生自灭，指挥官吉姆·雷诺挺身而出，肩负起拯救民众的重任。 /// The zerg had already reached the neighboring planet, Mar Sara, and Marshal Jim Raynor fought to save the terrified colonists as the Confederate government abandoned them to the alien menace.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00008=“克哈之子”介入其中，从异虫和星灵手中救出了上万条生命。对联邦政府极度失望的雷诺加入了起义军，并遇到了莎拉·凯瑞甘。 /// The Sons of Korhal intervened, saving thousands of lives from the rampaging zerg and enigmatic protoss. Disgusted by the Confederacy, Raynor joined the rebels and met Sarah Kerrigan.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00009=凯瑞甘曾是联邦的一名幽灵特工，她与雷诺都希望星区能够得到解放。随着起义的不断升级，他们渐渐成了默契的派档。 /// Kerrigan was a former Confederate ghost operative, and she shared Raynor's desire for a liberated Koprulu sector. They grew close as the battle with the Confederacy escalated.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00010=但蒙斯克渐渐被自己的仇恨和野心吞没。他在塔桑尼斯安放了灵能发射源，吸引异虫蜂拥而至，毁灭整个星球。 /// But Mengsk went too far in his hatred and ambition. He ordered devices placed on the Confederate capital world of Tarsonis to lure the zerg and annihilate the population.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00011=星灵在执行官塔萨达尔的率领下，决定协助人类对抗异虫，拯救塔桑尼斯。然而蒙斯克却派凯瑞甘前去阻止这次行动。 /// The protoss, led by Executor Tassadar, decided to help the Terrans defeat the zerg instead of purging the planet of life. Mengsk sent Kerrigan to stop Tassadar's interference.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00012=凯瑞甘对星灵的阻击，使整个塔桑尼斯被虫群毁灭，星球上生物也被屠戮殆尽。蒙斯克却转身离开，将凯瑞甘遗弃给了虫群。 /// With Kerrigan battling the protoss, the zerg overwhelmed Tarsonis and decimated the population. Having achieved his goals, Mengsk left the planet and abandoned Kerrigan to the aliens.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00013=蒙斯克的背叛令雷诺愤怒不已，他毅然离开“克哈之子”，想要去塔桑尼斯营救凯瑞甘，但凯瑞甘早已沦为异虫的俘虏。 /// Sickened by Mengsk's treachery, Raynor quit the Sons of Korhal. He raced to the planet's surface to save Kerrigan, but was too late: no trace of her remained.

Conversation/InstallerText/Line00015=雷诺为凯瑞甘的离去感到无比心痛，并发誓为她报仇。但出乎意料的是，凯瑞甘没有死。相反，她被虫群带到了火山星球——查尔。 /// Raynor mourned the loss of Kerrigan and vowed revenge. Unbeknownst to him, however, the zerg hadn't killed Kerrigan. Instead, they took her to the volcanic planet of Char.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00016=在查尔星球上，凯瑞甘被变为了外星生物“刀锋女王”。她拥有了无比强大的灵能，并效忠于虫群的统治者——主宰。 /// On Char, Kerrigan was transformed into the alien Queen of Blades. She became a being of immense psionic power, loyal to the Overmind, ruler of the zerg Swarm.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00017=除了塔萨达尔的星灵军队外，另一支潜于暗影之中的星灵也加入了战斗。泽拉图和他麾下的黑暗圣堂武士们在悄无声息地利用虚空能量阻止虫群的扩张。 /// Separate from Tassadar's forces, another protoss faction emerged from the shadows. Zeratul and his dark templar sought to end the zerg expansion through stealth and the power of the Void.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00018=尽管这两股星灵力量携手对抗虫群，但主宰还是发现了星灵的秘密家园“艾尔”。虫群向艾尔发动了侵略，主宰将自身植入了星球表面。 /// The two protoss forces joined together against the Swarm, but the Overmind was able to discover their secret homeworld of Aiur. The zerg quickly invaded, and the Overmind embedded itself in the planet's surface.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00019=塔萨达尔通过泽拉图得知了将虚空能量与自身能量结合的方法。他将虚空能量注入舰船，然后毅然撞向了凶残的主宰，与其同归于尽。 /// Zeratul taught Tassadar how to combine his powers with those of the Void.  Tassadar fused those energies into his ship, and crashed it into the gargantuan Overmind, destroying it utterly.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00020=虽然塔萨达尔牺牲了自己，但艾尔的星灵还是被迫逃往黑暗圣堂武士的家园“萨古拉斯”。面对失去首脑的虫群，凯瑞甘成为了最高统治者。 /// Despite Tassadar's sacrifice, the protoss on Aiur were forced to seek refuge on the dark templar homeworld of Shakuras. With the Overmind destroyed, Kerrigan assumed control of the zerg.

Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00001=希望我们的努力不会白费。 /// Hope that thing was worth all the effort. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00002=我们已经把所有神器碎片都给了瓦伦里安？ /// So we've transferred all the artifact pieces to Valerian's people?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00003=是啊，都没了。坦白说指挥官，在这里挑灯夜战，已经——已经快要让科研人员们支持不住了。 /// Yes, all gone. I'm sort of relieved to be honest, Commander. Working in here late at night was starting to -ah- you know, strain my scientific detachment.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00004=嗯，接下来就要靠莫比斯的科学家了。希望他们一切顺利。 /// Well it's down to the Moebius scientists to figure it all out now. I hope for their sake they get it right.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00005=是大家都一切顺利吧？ /// Don't you mean for all our sakes?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00006=不，我想的是，要是他们搞砸了，我怎么找他们算账。 /// No, I was thinking more about how I'll hunt every one of them down if they screw this thing up.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00007=我们用血汗换来了这神器……现在交给瓦伦里安，希望他能造出超级武器来制止凯瑞甘。 /// All that sweat and blood getting the artifacts... Now we've given them away to Valerian so he can build a super weapon to stop Kerrigan.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00008=奶奶的，但愿能管用，否则我的脑袋就真进水了。 /// Hell, this had better work or I'm just the dumbest jackass alive.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00009=你能给我介绍下这个神器吗？我得承认……我被它搞糊涂了。 /// Can you tell me anything about this artifact? I gotta admit... it kinda weirds me out.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00010=这东西真有趣，指挥官。初步分析显示其能量信号的辐射强度比任何有记载的外星遗物都要强10倍。 /// It really is fascinating, Commander. Preliminary analysis suggests that its energy signature radiates at ten times the magnitude of any previously recorded alien antiquities. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00011=喔，好吧——别不当回事，斯台特曼。搞不好它会弄开个黑洞，把船一口吞进去…… /// Yeah, well -- don't start pickin' at it, Stetmann. With our luck, it'd probably just open up a black hole and swallow the ship....
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00012=天哪，我可没把这种可能性算进去…… /// Goodness, I hadn't factored the odds of that potentiality... 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00013=指挥官，我一直在琢磨这些神器…… /// Oh -- Commander, Commander, Commander. I've been giving these artifacts some thought...
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00014=呃——别担心——我还没分析过它们或干过别的！没直接进行过…… /// Oh -- don't worry -- I know what you're gonna say -- I haven't been running diagnostics on them or anything! Well, at least not directly, at any rate...
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00015=有话就说，小子。 /// Just spit it out, son.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00016=好吧，长官——添加了第二块碎片后，四周的抑制力场明显更剧烈了。要想添加更多，必须从舰船的聚变芯体抽调更多能量来维持力场的正常。 /// Well, sir -- when the second piece was added? The ambient containment field spiked drastically. Hm, I know. If we add any more pieces, we'll need to draw even more power from the ship's fusion core to maintain the field. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00017=留着它们真是又危险又花钱。好吧，尽快把它们从我的船上弄出去。 /// So holding these things is dangerous and expensive. Well, the sooner we get 'em off my ship, the better.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00018=真庆幸这些东西……没把船整个炸掉。 /// I'm pleased to see these things haven't blown up the ship... Yet.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00019=长官，这几片在外观上如此相似，你有没有想过也许它们能够拼出一个更大、更强的东西？ /// Sir, given the visual similarity between the various pieces, have you considered that they might combine to create a larger, more distinct object? 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00020=斯台特曼， 局势混乱，我没空操这个闲心。只要能顺利交给那群莫比斯人，拿到工钱就行了。 /// With everything else going on, Stetmann, I couldn't care less what they do, just that we get paid when we finally hand 'em over to the Moebius boys. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00021=所以这些神器是解救凯瑞甘的关键…… /// So these artifacts are the key to freeing Kerrigan...
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00022=真是难以置信的巧合，泰凯斯恰好在那时候出现……给我们介绍了这么个活。 /// Pretty amazing coincidence, Tychus just showing up out of the blue... offering us the job to collect these damn things.  
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00023=从统计学来看，长官——这种巧合的概率是微乎其微的。但这些神器的确超越了我们目前对科学的理解…… /// Statistically, sir -- the probability of coincidence is miniscule. However, these artifacts do represent a power beyond our current scientific understanding... 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00024=要是有东西能阻止刀锋女王——就是这神器了？ /// If anything could the give the Queen of Blades pause - perhaps these are it?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00025=相信很快就会有结果了。 /// Guess we'll find out soon enough. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00026=我做了一些前期研究。这些神器已经有几千年的历史了，但从异种考古学来看还非常“年轻”。大多数的外星神器都有几百万年的历史了。相比之下这个还是近期制造的。 /// I've done some preliminary studies. Your artifact is a few thousand years old, but that makes it pretty 'young' in Xeno-archaelogical terms. Most alien artifacts are millions of years old. By comparison, this one was made recently.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00027=根据我的经验，这不像是星灵造的。但如果不是他们……那会是谁呢？ /// It ain't like anything protoss I've ever seen. But if they didn't make it... who did?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00028=所有这些……上古啊外星之类的鬼东西让我都糊涂了。我只希望当时机到来的时候…… /// All this... ancient alien hocus-pocus is a little outta my pay scale. I just pray that when the time comes...
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00029=……能让她回到我的身边。 /// ...these things bring her back to me.  
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00030=最近我从船员那听到了一些怪事 —— 不明的噪音、奇怪的幻象 —— 黑暗中的低语。有谣传说那些东西在闹鬼。 /// I've been hearing strange stories from the crew of late - unexplained noises, strange visions - voices in the dark. Rumor has it these things are haunted.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00031=都是一派胡言！那些神器毫无运转迹象，它们都放在下层实验室里。的确有些微弱的辐射，但我不觉得那能影响到其它地方！ /// Superstitious nonsense! These artifacts are completely inert and they're contained down here in the lab. There is some trace radiation, but I don't see how they could affect things elsewhere on the ship!
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00032=[Surprise]上帝不让我们接触外星科技，它们会干扰我这种猿人的脑子。[/Surprise]你好好看着它们吧，博士。 /// [Surprise]Heaven forbid we run across alien tech that messes with our primitive little monkey brains.[/Surprise] Just keep a close eye on 'em, Doc.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00033=持有这些神器让我紧张。关于它们你还知道什么？ /// Holding these artifacts is making me nervous. Can you tell me any more about them?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00034=很有意思 —— 从席尔找来的那个与众不同。但我觉得，它们都是某种设备的零件。 /// It's interesting - the one from Xil is different than the others. However, I think all of them once constituted a single device. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00035=它们能组成个更大的？ /// You mean they make something bigger? 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00036=看起来是的。这只是一个论断，但我们收集来的神器之间互相有着某种吸引 —— 好像是某种谐波共振。 /// It would seem so. It's just a theory, but there's an attraction between the artifacts we've collected - a kind of harmonic resonance. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00037=根据相邻交界线的排列来看，我觉得它们在正确的力场调整下会像磁铁那样相互吸附。 /// Given the points of contiguous translinear alignment I think they'd be drawn together like magnets under the right field adjustment.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00038=哦，行了行了行了，先别做任何调整，博士。还是原封不动吧。 /// Ohhhh kay. Well don't adjust anything just yet, Doc. I like them aligned just the way they are.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00039=看来这东西还挺复杂的，是吧？ /// So these things are still a big mystery, huh?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00040=其实我已经发现了一些有意思的东西。每次使用那个星灵设备，这些神器都会以相互吸附和扩展分子矩阵的方式做出回应。 /// Actually I have found something interesting. Whenever you use that protoss device over there, the artifacts respond by drawing together and expanding their molecular matrices.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00041=请说得慢点儿，简单点儿。 /// A little slower and with shorter words, please.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00042=呃，你可以把他们比作干海绵，海绵会吸收周围的水分。这些东西会无尽地吸收能量。 /// Well, if you think of them as dry sponges, they draw ambient energy like water. These things try to absorb as much energy as they can.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00043=他们危险吗？ /// Are they dangerous?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00044=如果我的理论没错的话，对人没什么危险。 —— 但你要是个星灵—— 这东西会把你的生命吸干。 /// Not if you're human. If my theories are correct - and you were a protoss, for instance - they could drain the life right out of you.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00045=瓦伦里安认为这个东西修复后……可以把凯瑞甘从虫子变回人。你觉得可能吗？ /// Valerian reckons this thing can...de-zergify Kerrigan once it's rebuilt. Do you think that's even possible?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00046=从我正在拼凑的东西来看，有这个可能。这些神器好像能吸收星灵的能量。如果对虫子也有效的话…… /// From what I've managed to piece together, it might be. The artifact seems to absorb protoss energy. If the same holds true for zerg...
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00047=能还是不能，艾蕊尔。我不想听别的！ /// (Snaps) Just yes or no, Ariel. I need an answer!
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00048=如果我说“不能”，你愿意相信吗？真正清楚神器作用的人就是它的制造者 —— 但他们早就不在了……也许是的。 /// (snaps back) If I said 'no' would you even believe me? The only person who can really know what the artifact does is the one who made it - and they're long gone...I hope.

Conversation/LabHanson/Line00017=我和她……其实，是老相识了。她曾经是个特工。那时候我们跟着蒙斯克起义，共同推翻联邦的统治。我们还挺合得来。 /// Me and her... well, we go back a ways. She was a Ghost, once. Back then we were hooked up with Mengsk and fighting to get rid of the old Confederacy. (beat) We made a pretty good team.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00018=她后来怎么了？ /// What happened to her?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00024=是的……还有几十亿无辜平民。从那以后，我们终于看清了蒙斯克的真面目。 /// Her...plus a few billion innocent civilians. After that we knew exactly what kind of man we'd been dealing with. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00027=她是个战争的牺牲品。对不起，博士，我不想谈这件事。 /// She was a casualty of war. No offense, Doc, but I really don't like to talk about it.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00031=塔桑尼斯……恶梦开始的地方。蒙斯克把一台偷来的灵能发射源安装在塔桑尼斯。他清楚这会吸引虫子还会…… /// (bitter) Tarsonis... that's where it all went down. Mengsk stole a psi-emitter from the Confederacy and planted it there. He knew that it'd attract the zerg and... 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00034=出于好奇，我曾经对红石的晶体矿做过实验。我想得告诉你 —— 我发现了微量的幽金，一种属性非常独特的稀有水晶。 /// Just out of curiosity, I did some tests on the minerals from Redstone. I thought you should know - I found trace quantities of jorium, a rare crystal with very unique properties. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00035=洗耳恭听，博士。什么属性？ /// I'm all ears, Doc. What kind of properties?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00036=幽金可以同特定的脑波进行同频共振。有一种理论，幽金可以用来刺激大脑活动，甚至是让人类对象获得灵能。 /// Jorium resonates at the same frequency as certain brain waves. It's been theorized that it could be used to stimulate brain activity or even produce psionic abilities in human subjects.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00038=灵能应激能力的突然提升的确会导致暂时性的精神错乱，但幽魂特工并不像她所说的那么邪恶。诺娃在撒谎。 /// A sudden increase in psionic ability could induce a psychotic break, but Spectres aren't the monsters we were led to believe. Nova lied to us.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00039=托什究竟在搞什么名堂？ /// What the hell does Tosh want that for?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00040=能想到那是干什么的吗？ /// Any guesses what it's used for?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00041=贸然使用它们可是会有危险的。 /// They can be dangerous if you don't know what you're doin'.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00042=很多事我都已经看淡了，但在我咽气前一定要看到蒙斯克的倒台！ /// I don't care about much of anything anymore, but the one thing I hold onto is seeing Mengsk brought to justice before I die.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00044=革命就在那天开始 —— 蒙斯克谋害了整一个星球，却称此为正义。 /// (sighs) Our revolution began that day - the day Mengsk murdered a whole planet and called it justice.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00047=吉姆，我一直在调查诺娃提到的关于幽魂特工变成杀人狂的事。 /// Jim, I've been investigating the claims that Nova made about Spectres turning into psychotic killers. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00049=真难以置信。那录音证明一切都是真的；蒙斯克、塔桑尼斯、一切的一切……你现在打算怎么做？ /// I can't believe it. That recording proves it's all true; Mengsk, Tarsonis, all of it... What will you do now?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00050=告知天下。不论男女老少，我要让每一个人都知道，他们敬爱的统治者的丑恶嘴脸。 /// Tell the people. Every man, woman and child in the Dominion needs to know what their beloved Emperor is capable of.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00051=这可能会激起轩然大波。各地都会爆发暴动和起义……但这正合你意，不是吗？ /// The backlash will be awful. There'll be riots and uprisings everywhere... But that's just what you want, isn't it?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00052=这只是开始。 /// It's a start.

Conversation/LabHanson/Line00056=我们有机会处理凯瑞甘的问题，可能，只是说可能，局势会因此扭转。明知这是在和魔鬼做交易，可我还是答应了。 /// We've got a chance to take on Kerrigan and maybe, just maybe, set things right. The devil himself could offer me that deal and I'd still take it.

ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryBanshee/Info/Description 2=由帝国军方发明，用于镇压移民起义军的女妖，无论是在城市还是野外的作战环境下都表现得十分出色。其迅捷、隐秘的战斗能力很快便使其成为对抗异虫、星灵和人类叛敌的主力军。 /// Created by the Dominion military to terrorize rebellious colonists, the banshee was used to great effect in urban and rural settings. Its agile, sneaky capabilities quickly propelled it onto the front lines against zerg, protoss, and terran foes.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryBanshee/Info/Description 3=DN51女妖隐形发生器是帝国军方最为精密的火力装备之一。一旦有女妖战机被击落，军方即会派出专门小组取回发生器 — 或将其摧毁。 /// The DN51 banshee cloak generator is one of the most sophisticated pieces of equipment in the Dominion arsenal.

ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryFirebat/Info/Description=“火焰能褪尽骨骼上的皮肉，也能荡涤萦于心头的罪恶。它能洗掉一切污浊。我妈妈从小就教我要讲卫生。”<n/><n/>火蝠作战第一人 — 洗心革面的杀人狂 — 弗兰克·提尔顿如是说。 /// "Fire washes the skin off the bone and the sin off the soul. It cleans away the dirt. And my momma didn't raise herself no dirty boy." <n/><n/>--Franko Tildon, widely credited as the first fighting firebat, reformed mass murderer
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryFirebat/Info/Description 2=火蝠护甲材料中混合的强挥发性气体能够渗入使用者的密闭空间，也许正因为如此，火蝠兵通常都是些经过改造的罪犯或是能够适应这种环境的家伙。 /// The firebat suit contains a volatile mix of gasses that seep into the operator compartment. This may explain why firebat personnel are almost universally resocialized criminals or psychotic pyromaniacs.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryFirebat/Info/Description 3=毁灭之炎喷射器向敌方目标喷射燃烧电浆。燃烧电浆轻易即可渗入异虫甲壳。体型较小的异虫可谓是裹在自己的皮肤里被活活烧死。 /// Perdition flamethrowers spew combusto-plasma at enemy targets.

Winston reported that the weapon was "sexier than [his] girlfriend and twice as nice."
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryGhostRifle/Info/Description 2=由联邦政府在塔桑尼斯陷落前引进的玛克VI型，被认为是幽灵防暴武器的巅峰之作。帝国军方无法在此设计基础上再做改进，因此延续了这一武器的生产。 /// Introduced by the Confederacy shortly before the fall of Tarsonis, the Mark VI is considered the pinnacle of ghost antipersonnel weaponry. The Dominion, unable to improve upon the design, has carried on production.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryGhostRifle/Info/Description 3=尽管有着极强的作战能力，幽灵发动聚变打击的精准度却是相当不敢恭维。现代的指挥官们通常比较喜欢幽灵步枪这一发明，因为其内部装有可用于校验坐标的磁性追踪器。 /// Despite their great skill, ghosts are notoriously sloppy when calling down nuclear strikes.

She later murdered two marines who reportedly insisted on referring to the medivac as a "heal bus." <n/><n/>She is rumored to be resocialized and serving happily in the Dominion military.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryMedivac/Info/Description 2=第19陆战师的医疗兵们最早是临时起意，在塔隆-7上的酸雨风暴期间把运输船改造成为具备远程遥控功能的医疗运输机。这一创造将医疗兵的平均寿命提高了几个小时。 /// Medics of the 19th Dominion Marine Division first improvised the medivac by modifying a dropship to allow remote control during the acid storms on Thalon VII. This added tens of minutes to the life expectancy of medics.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryMedivac/Info/Description 3=陆战队员们仍然不信任激光手术刀的精确度，也无法对自动缝合器的精准性持乐观态度。这两个医疗器材均由最低投标人 — 普罗希昂工业集团发明。 /// Marines still do not trust the accuracy of the scalpel laser, nor are they optimistic about the precision of the auto-suture, both of which were developed by Procyon Industries, the lowest bidder.

Sgt. Slovens was subsequently cut off and surrounded when he failed to hear the order to fall back.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmorySiegeTank/Info/Description 2=装有双90毫米口径火炮的穿冲攻城坦克是早期弧光攻城坦克的升级版。“攻城模式”下使用的180毫米口径震击炮同比旧型号的伤害范围扩大了50%。 /// Armed with twin 90mm cannons, the Crucio is an expensive upgrade to the original Arclite siege tank. The 180mm "siege mode" shock cannon scatters superheated tungsten in a 50% larger area.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmorySiegeTank/Info/Description 3=帝国步兵普遍认为，穿冲攻城坦克对友军造成的伤害远超于敌军。后来，不受欢迎的穿冲攻城坦克驾驶员们在假期只好“臭味相投”般的聚在一起。 /// Dominion infantry soldiers are universally convinced that Crucio operators inflict more damage on friendly forces than on the enemy.

Ms. Roche disappeared a week later and has not been seen since.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmorySpectreCrates/Info/Description 2=幽魂训练营的一个负面训练效果就是使幽魂染上了更多怪癖。许多幽魂纹上图腾纹身或是佩戴其它饰物，藉此“提升”其作战能力。 /// A side effect of the spectre training regimen is a marked increase in eccentricity. Many spectres carry totems or other trinkets to "enhance" their abilities.

Few pilots can master both forms of the vehicle. A viking pilot is a "cherry" until he's been inside of one during a transformation.

Its density has increased 553% in the last twelve hours. Where does it get energy or raw materials for that? I have a terrible suspicion that it's... connecting to the ship somehow. If Swann suspects, he'll drop it out the airlock, and that would be a tragedy.

I'm now convinced that the crystal is drawing power from the ship, but in ways so subtle as to be undetectable. <n/><n/>It is non-organic but has a molecular structure as diverse and complex as any organism's. It's developed an intricate matrix that makes it tough and surprisingly flexible. An alloy based on this crystal would have impressive damage mitigation. The structure of this matrix also suggests some sort of energy-storage system. There might be something to this.<n/><n/>The protoss are so far beyond us. We must seem amoeboid to them.</s>

I no longer think it is drawing power from the ship. It's getting pure energy from that sphere above it, which presents a new worry. What's it doing with all that power? Is it going to release it explosively? I have to keep Swann away from the sample; he will definitely shoot it out the airlock. With me strapped to it.<n/><n/>I tried scraping smaller samples, but all my tools broke. Luckily, I found some cast-off chips floating in the tank. Wonder how they came off? In any case, the chips revealed more of the matrix. It's keeping the energy there in a vortex. How does it move the energy so fast? It may be the fabled protoss warp technology. For all its complexity, the matrix is as solid as the strongest structure. Hm, I wonder if I could apply these dynamics to our own structures?

It's obviously an energy emitter, but it has such strong containment that the crystal can slowly draw power from it via some method I don't understand. That gives me an idea: using our own containment technology, I could modify our SCV manufacturing process to double capacity with no increased risk. I think.<n/><n/>Breakthrough! The energy in this crystal is not kept in a vortex pattern. It was warping the energy around so fast that I couldn't detect it. In an odd coincidence, the warping slowed just enough for my sensors to pick it up. Not sure how or why.

I put a broken nano-fabricator in the tank last night, and today it's fixed.  And it can accomplish things it shouldn't. If I can reverse engineer this fabricator, I could do amazing things with automated repair, or even near-instant manufacturing of advanced AI weaponry. Possibilities are limitless.<n/><n/>On the less upbeat end of things, the level of energy stored in the crystal's matrix has not increased at all, despite the fact that the crystal continues to grow.

I haven't truly learned anything from this crystal. I've just observed the smallest details from it and somehow wrangled a few tidbits when the crystal... helped me. I don't understand how the protoss can possess technology of this magnitude and not rule the known universe. Perhaps they simply don't want to?<n/><n/>Last entry on this sample. I figured out where it is putting all that excess energy. It's feeding the Hyperion. Subtly helping to power the ship, balancing out some of the more ragged systems.
