EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CDSPCustomCompressor_AttackMs=How long the compressor takes to fully activate (milliseconds)
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CDSPCustomCompressor_Ratio=However much the sound is above ThresholdDB, that DB level will be decreased by this percent. 0.75 would mean to bring it down 75% in DB (not amplitude). 1 would disallow it from going above ThresholdDB at all (0 to 1 percentage)
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CDSPCustomCompressor_ReleaseMs=How long the compressor should take to de-activate from being fully activated (milliseconds)
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CDSPCustomCompressor_ThresholdDB=When the RMS is above this threshold the compressor will work towards activation (will do attack), when the RMS is below this threshold, the compressor will work towards deactivation (will do release).  (db)
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CDSPCustomCompressor_MakeUpGainDB=The volume is adjusted by this amount after compression is performed (db)
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CDSPCustomCompressor_DelayMs=When the compressor should be activating, it will have to activate for this long before actually starting to apply the compression effects (milliseconds)
