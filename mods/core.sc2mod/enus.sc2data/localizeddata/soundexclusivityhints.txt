EDSTR_ENUMHINT_e_soundExclusivityFlagSupressionInterrupts=If true, suppressed groups will have their currently playing sounds interrupted.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSoundExclusivity_Group=The exclusivity group of the sound.  All sounds played using this group will consider each other for exclusivity.  Sounds from other groups, or who don't have any group, will not be considered for exclusivity tests.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSoundExclusivity_Priority=The priority within the exclusivity group.  Used to make decisions about which sounds are more important than others.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSoundExclusivity_CollideWithLower=What action to take if a lower priority sound is already playing when the sound wants to play.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSoundExclusivity_CollideWithEqual=What action to take if an equal priority sound is already playing when the sound wants to play.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSoundExclusivity_CollideWithHigher=What action to take if a higher priority sound is already playing when the sound wants to play.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSoundExclusivity_QCollideWithLower=What action to take if a lower priority sound is already queued when the sound wants to enter the queue.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSoundExclusivity_QCollideWithEqual=What action to take if an equal priority sound is already queued when the sound wants to enter the queue.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSoundExclusivity_QCollideWithHigher=What action to take if a higher priority sound is already queued when the sound wants to enter the queue.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSoundExclusivity_QTimeout=If the sound is queued for longer than this amount of time (in ms), it will give up and leave the queue without playing. A value of zero means it will never time out.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSoundExclusivity_QDelay=When a sound is dequeued, it will wait this long (in ms) before playing.  This delay does not count towards the queue timeout time.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSoundExclusivity_InterruptFadeBlend=If this sound is interrupted, it will blend out using this setting.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSoundExclusivity_InterruptFade=If this sound is interrupted, it will blend out using this setting.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSoundExclusivity_InterruptDelay=If this sound is interrupted, the sound interrupting it will delay it's playback by this amount to allow this sound to fade out etc.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSoundExclusivity_SuppressGroups=When a sound plays using this exclusivity data record, it will suppress these group numbers for ALL owning players.  Sounds in those groups will not be able to be played again until this sound is finished, and if the SupressionInterrupts flag is set, currently playing sounds will be interrupted.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSoundExclusivity_DupeWait=Prevent a sound using this exclusivity record from playing within this amount of time.
