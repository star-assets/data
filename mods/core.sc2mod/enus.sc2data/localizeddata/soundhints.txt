EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundAssetTemplate_File=The pattern to use to fill in sound asset file, if a TemplateParam is specified.  Leave blank to not include in the template replacement. use ^TemplateParam^ where you want the template Id parameter to go.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundAssetTemplate_FacialAnim=The pattern to use to fill in sound asset facial anim, if a TemplateParam is specified.  Leave blank to not include in the template replacement. use ^TemplateParam^ where you want the template Id parameter to go.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundAssetTemplate_FacialGroup=The pattern to use to fill in sound asset facial group, if a TemplateParam is specified.  Leave blank to not include in the template replacement. use ^TemplateParam^ where you want the template Id parameter to go.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundAssetTemplate_FacialFile=The pattern to use to fill in sound asset facial file, if a TemplateParam is specified.  Leave blank to not include in the template replacement. use ^TemplateParam^ where you want the template Id parameter to go.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundAssetTemplate_PortraitAnim=The pattern to use to fill in sound asset protrait anim, if a TemplateParam is specified.  Leave blank to not include in the template replacement. use ^TemplateParam^ where you want the template Id parameter to go.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSyncPointRange_BarAndBeat=When should this range begin in bars and beats from the beginning of the sound? This is 1 based, not 0 based so bar/beat 1.1 is the first beat in the sound.  Bar/beat 5.1 would be the first beat of the 5th bar.  This field is ignored for the first entry as there is no previous entry.  The first entry starts at sample zero.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSyncPointRange_TimeSignature=The time signature of this section. X/Y where the top number says how many notes of Y type are in each bar.  For instance 3,4 would be a 3/4 time signature which means there are three (3) quarter-notes (4) per bar.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSyncPointRange_BeatsPerMinute=The tempo of this section in beats per minute.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSyncPointRange_SyncPointsPerBar=how many sync points should be made per bar.  Zero means there will be no sync points in this range.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundAsset_TemplateParam=When a TemplateParam is given, fields below will be filled out based on the asset array template field.  The intention of this field is to save time entering data if your parameters have a consistent pattern.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSound_CategoryLocal=The category to use for this sound if the player is the local (observed) player.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSound_DupePrioritization=This determines the order that duplicate sounds are destroyed in.  Default = mixer priority, distance, audibility.  Oldest = Oldest Destroyed First.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSound_Exclusivity=Determines whether this sound can be prevented from playing, or delayed, due to other sounds currently being played.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSound_MixerPriority=A sound with a higher priority than another sound will not be stolen or made virtual by that sound. 0 = most important. 256 = least important. A value of -1 means to use the mixer priority of the sound category for this sound.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSound_MixerPriorityNonLocal=Mixer priority to use for non local sounds. A value of -1 means to use the same priority as local sounds.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSound_PanLevelNonLocal=The pan level to use for non local sounds. Less than zero means to use the value in pan level.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSound_PlayDelay=How long to delay playing this sound (in ms)
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSound_PositionRandomOffset=The position of the sound will be randomly offset by up to this amount either positively or negatively.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSound_PositionRandomOffsetPower=This is used to modify the distribution of the random offset.  The percentage offset on each axis (0..1) is taken to this power.  Less than 1 means that points will tend to be more towards the edges.  Greater than one 1 means the points will tend to be more towards the center.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSound_SpeakerMixNonLocal=The speaker mix to use if this sound is played for a non local player. -1 means to use the value in SpeakerMix.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSound_LocalVolumeAdjustment=Applies a volume adjustment when the sound is played owned by the local player.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSound_NonLocalVolumeAdjustment=Applies a volume adjustment when the sound is played not owned by the local player.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSound_CategoryDuckingLocal=A sound mix snapshot to use for category ducking when this sound plays as a local sound.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CSound_CategoryDuckingNonLocal=A sound mix snapshot to use for category ducking when this sound plays as a non local sound.
