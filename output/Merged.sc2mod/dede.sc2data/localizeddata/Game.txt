Skin/Info/Adept,Als umfassend ausgebildete Schlachtfeldkommandanten nutzen Adepten Richter-Technologie, um ihr psionisches Potential zu erhöhen. So können sie Schemen ihrer selbst projizieren und sich über große Distanzen hinweg teleportieren.=16300
Skin/Info/AdeptCE,Die Raumschmieden der Daelaam mögen in der Lage sein, die Waffensysteme der Richter auf Glacius nachzubauen, doch reichen diese nicht an die optimierte Leistung von Karax' eigenen Prototypen heran.=16301
Skin/Info/AdeptGolden,Nach dem letzten Krieg hat sich unter den Templern eine gewisse Nostalgie breitgemacht. Einige Adepten haben sogar angefangen, zeremonielle Rüstung aus längst vergangenen Zeiten als Ausdruck ihres Stolzes zu tragen.=16302
Skin/Info/AdeptIhanrii,Selbst die kampferprobten Adepten der Ihan-rii brauchten etwas Zeit, um sich in ihrer Umgebung zurechtzufinden, nachdem ein Notrufsignal sie aus ihrer Stasis am Rande des Koprulu-Sektors erweckt hatte. /// Even battle-hardened Ihan-rii adepts needed time to get their bearings after a distress signal woke them from deep stasis on the fringes of the Koprulu Sector.=16303
Skin/Info/AdeptPurifier,Diese K.I.-Krieger wurden von Phasenschmied Karax perfektioniert und sind zu einem zentralen Teil der Richter-Armee geworden. Sie beeindrucken mit ihrer Beweglichkeit und ihrer Finesse.=16304
Skin/Info/AdeptTaldarim,Obwohl die Psi-Verstärkungstechnologie erst kürzlich für die Adepten der Daelaam entwickelt wurde, haben die Tal'darim sie bereits rekonstruiert und ihre vielversprechendsten Krieger damit ausgerüstet.=16305
Skin/Info/Archon,Archons bündeln überwältigende psionische Macht, doch hat diese einen hohen Preis. Zwei Templer müssen sich opfern, um einen Archon zu erschaffen. Das macht sie zur Personifizierung unvergleichlichen Heldentums.=16306
Skin/Info/Armory,Das Waffenlager wird um mehrere Turbinen herum errichtet. Diese sorgen für stabile Temperaturen, während die Forscher im Inneren unermüdlich daran arbeiten, die terranische Kriegsmaschinerie zu verbessern.=16307
Skin/Info/ArmoryCovertOps,Die jüngsten Fortschritte in Sachen Neostahlpanzerung sind der Untersuchung der Molekularstruktur von Xel'Naga-Konstrukten zu verdanken, welche von Spezialkräften beschafft wurden.=16308
Skin/Info/ArmorySilver,Nach mehreren Vorfällen, bei denen Protoss die Waffenlager auf Tyrador IX betraten, wurden Spionagevorwürfe laut. Die Führung der Ihan-rii beteuerte jedoch, dass die Siedler diese glänzenden Gebäude lediglich für terranische Museen gehalten hatten. /// Reports of protoss wandering into Tyrador IX's armories led to accusations of espionage, though Ihan-rii leadership insisted that these incidents were the result of settlers mistaking the gleaming structures for terran museums.=16309
Skin/Info/Assimilator,Auch die hoch fortschrittlichen Protoss wissen die vielfältigen Anwendungsmöglichkeiten von Vespingas zu schätzen. Sie haben Assimilatoren entwickelt, um diese wertvolle Ressource für sich nutzen zu können.=16310
Skin/Info/AssimilatorForged,Die Assimilatoren der Tal'darim reißen das Vespingas buchstäblich aus dem Boden. Dabei werden des Öfteren Erdbeben ausgelöst, unter denen die ansässigen Ökosysteme schwerstens zu leiden haben.=16311
Skin/Info/AssimilatorIhanrii,Die Protoss der Ihan-rii sehen es als ungemein großzügig an, dass sie den Terranern weiterhin erlauben, auf ihrer uralten und heiligen Heimatwelt Arakyr zu leben und sogar Vespingas abzubauen. /// The Ihan-rii protoss consider themselves very generous for allowing terrans to continue living on, let alone mining vespene gas from, their ancient and sacred homeworld, which they call Arakyr.=16312
Skin/Info/AssimilatorTaldarim,[ph] AssimilatorTaldarim info=16313
Skin/Info/Baneling,Der Berstling ist eine höchst instabile und explosive Angriffseinheit, die aus dem Zergling hervorgeht. Er wurde zum ersten Mal bei der Belagerung von Cask beobachtet und nur wenige Materialien halten der aggressiven Säure stand, die bei seiner Explosion freigesetzt wird.=16314
Skin/Info/BanelingMecha,Die Entwicklung der Berstlinge war für die Ingenieure eine besondere Herausforderung, da die echten Berstlingen vorsichtig entnommenen Säurebeutel sich immer wieder durch die Panzerung fraßen. Schließlich fand man aber eine Lösung.=16315
Skin/Info/BanelingNest,Ein Zerg-Schwarmcluster braucht ein Berstlingnest, um den genetischen Code dieser Art bereitzustellen. Mit einer solchen Struktur kann dann jeder existierende Zergling einen fleischigen Kokon bilden und eine kurze Verpuppung durchlaufen, nach der er als Berstling wieder schlüpft. Diese widerlichen Kreaturen sind so prall gefüllt mit Säure, dass die grünen Blasen auf ihrem Rücken mit der Flüssigkeit hin und her wiegen. /// The zerg hive cluster must have a baneling nest to add the baneling breed's genetic code. Once a nest is in place, any zergling on the field can be commanded to form a fleshy chrysalis for a brief pupation state, and then it will burst forth as a baneling--a foul, bloated creature with bulbous, acid-filled green sacs pulsating on its back.=16316
Skin/Info/BanelingNestMecha,Der obere Teil dieses Replika-Berstlingnests wird von derselben Antigravitationstechnologie in der Luft gehalten, die auch bei terranischen Schweren Kreuzern zum Einsatz kommt.=16317
Skin/Info/BanelingNestRCZ,Um die wichtigsten Befestigungen der Terraner zum Einsturz zu bringen, wurden Zerberus-Berstlingnester so manipuliert, dass sie in Höhlensystemen auf ganz Tyrador IX zur Explosion gebracht werden können. /// To trigger the collapse of key terran fortifications, Cerberus baneling nests have been rigged to detonate in cave networks across Tyrador IX.=16318
Skin/Info/BanelingPrimal,Inspiriert von den Berstlingen in Kerrigans Schwarm, hat Dehaka die Mutation einer ähnlichen Gattung in seinem Rudel angeregt.=16319
Skin/Info/BanelingRCZ,Das gesamte Nervensystem eines Berstlings auszutauschen, nur um die Einheit dann nach wenigen Minuten auf dem Schlachtfeld in die Luft zu jagen, ist aus wirtschaftlicher Sicht mehr als fragwürdig. Glücklicherweise haben Kunden von Zerberus viel Geld zur Verfügung. /// The return on investment for replacing a baneling's entire nervous system, only to have it immediately blow up, is dubious. Luckily, Cerberus's clients have quite a lot of money to spend.=16320
Skin/Info/BanelingWebby,Die stacheligen Auswüchse der Zerglinge der Leviathan-Brut bleiben sogar an den Säureblasen ihrer Berstlinge bestehen. Selbst eine umfassende Metamorphose vermag es nicht, ihre chaotischen Kernessenzen zu verändern.=16321
Skin/Info/Banshee,Die Banshees wurden von Procyon Industries so entworfen, dass sie gleichzeitig sparsam und effektiv sind. Sie unterstützen die Infanterie an vorderster Front aus der Luft und sind auch ideal, um Präzisionsschläge gegen den Gegner zu führen.=16322
Skin/Info/BansheeCovertOps,Die Ingenieure der Liga haben kritische Verbesserungen an den VTOL-Zwillingsrotoren der Banshee vorgenommen. Im Zusammenspiel mit neuen Vertikalstabilisatoren im Heck des Luftfahrzeugs werden so Stabilität und Leistung verbessert.=16323
Skin/Info/BansheeJunker,Söldner sind berüchtigt dafür, fremde Rüstungsteile an ihre Gefährte zu hämmern. Diese Banshees bilden dabei keine Ausnahme. Gerüchte besagen, dass in diesem spezifischen Design Teile eines Bulldozers verbaut wurden.=16324
Skin/Info/BansheeSilver,Die meisten Banshees von Tyrador wurden gleich beim ersten Angriff der Zerberus-Zerg ausgelöscht. Dennoch gelang es einem erfahrenen Piloten, vorher noch drei Ultralisken auszuschalten. /// Though most Tyrador banshees were wiped out in the first wave of the Cerberus zerg attack, one seasoned pilot managed to take down three ultralisks first. =16325
Skin/Info/BansheeUmojan,Durch eine Reihe zwielichtiger Geschäfte ist es dem Protektorat von Umoja gelungen, eine begrenzte Anzahl an Banshees zu erlangen. Der Lieferant Procyon Industries hat diese Modelle als gestohlen gemeldet.=16326
Skin/Info/Barracks,Die terranische Kaserne dient der Infanterie als "Zuhause für unterwegs". Sie ist steril, mobil und kann überall auf effiziente Weise zum Einsatz kommen.=16327
Skin/Info/BarracksCovertOps,Das unheimliche blaue Leuchten dieser Spezialkräfte-Kaserne stammt von einem Kühlungssystem mit flüssigem Stickstoff.=16328
Skin/Info/BarracksSilver,Jede Kaserne der Wächter von Tyrador ist mit einer automatisierten 5-Sterne-Küche und einem Erholungsbereich mit Rundumservice ausgestattet – natürlich nur für Offiziere. /// Each Knights of Tyrador barracks features a five-star robotic kitchen and a full-service spa--for officers only, of course.=16329
Skin/Info/Battlecruiser,Schwere Kreuzer dienen oft als mobile Hauptquartiere auf längeren militärischen Feldzügen. Sie sind fliegende Festungen mit schwerer Panzerung und imposanter Feuerkraft.=16330
Skin/Info/BattlecruiserCovertOps,Nach einem langwierigen F&E-Prozess wurden die neuen Schweren Kreuzer der Moira-Klasse ausschließlich in den Dienst der Spezialkräfte der Liga gestellt.=16331
Skin/Info/BattlecruiserJunker,Diese grimmig aussehenden Schiffe wurden modifiziert, um den Vorlieben der Söldner zu entsprechen. Allerdings leben nur wenige Außenstehende lange genug, um diese Handwerkskünste zu bewundern.=16332
Skin/Info/BattlecruiserRemastered,Während des Brood War wurden Schwere Kreuzer mit tiefergelegten Kommandodecks gebaut. So hatte man im Fall eines Zerg-Überraschungsangriffs optimale Sicht von den Observationsdecks an Back- und Steuerbord.=16333
Skin/Info/BattlecruiserSilver,Als ihr Planet von Zerberus-Zerg angegriffen wurde, entsandten die Wächter von Tyrador einen Schweren Kreuzer der Behemoth-Klasse mit der Mission, die Flotte Steinschiffe im stillen Orbit um Unterstützung zu bitten. /// Assailed by Cerberus zerg, the Knights of Tyrador dispatched a Behemoth-class battlecruiser to request aid from the stone ships waiting in silent orbit.=16334
Skin/Info/BattlecruiserUmojan,Umojanische Schwere Kreuzer weisen eine überarbeitete Neostahlpanzerung und Verbesserungen an den Yamato-Kanonen auf, wodurch sie in Schlachten von entscheidender Bedeutung sein können.=16335
Skin/Info/BroodLord,Brutlords stehen an der Spitze der Evolution und wurden entwickelt, um die Lüfte zu beherrschen. Trotz ihrer Anmut sind sie furchterregende Wesen, die feindlichen Streitkräften mit ihren zerstörerischen Brütlingen schwer zusetzen.=16336
Skin/Info/BroodLordMecha,Nachdem sie ihre Arbeit an dem Brutlord-Prototyp abgeschlossen hatten und dieser alle Erwartungen übertraf, bekamen die für die Entwicklung zuständigen Wissenschaftler von Projekt Replika Sonderurlaub. Merkwürdigerweise kehrten sie nie wieder zurück.=16337
Skin/Info/BroodLordPrimal,Eine kleine Zahl Brutlords wurde in die Rudel der Urzerg integriert. Das führte zu einer andersartigen Kreatur, die sich vor allem durch ihre ungewöhnlichen Klauen auszeichnet.=16338
Skin/Info/BroodLordRCZ,Jeder Brütling, den der Zerberus-Brutlord aussendet, kann individuell von einem Kommandanten gesteuert werden, der fernab der eigentlichen Schlacht das Geschehen auf einer Steuerkonsole überwacht. /// Each broodling dispatched from the Cerberus brood lord can be controlled individually by a commander safe at a computer console, far away from the actual battle.=16339
Skin/Info/BroodLordWebby,Obwohl sie erst relativ spät in den Schwarm integriert wurden, zeigen viele Brutlords noch die genetischen Merkmale der Leviathan-Brut. Dies ist wahrscheinlich ein Anzeichen für frühe Essenzexperimente des Evolutionsmeisters Abathur.=16340
Skin/Info/BroodLord_PremiumSkin_Aquatic,Im Zuge der Verseuchung eines Planeten mit ungewöhnlich ausgedehnten Meeresflächen passten sich einige Brutlords an ihre neue Umgebung an und entwickelten die Fähigkeit, auf der Jagd nach Beute in große Tiefen zu tauchen.=16341
Skin/Info/Bunker,Aufgrund ihrer Allgegenwärtigkeit und der fehlenden Annehmlichkeiten bezeichnen die terranischen Infanteristen ihre Bunker auch als "Schlachtfeldsärge".=16342
Skin/Info/BunkerCovertOps,Die nächste Generation Liga-Bunker kann dem vollen Gewicht eines ausgewachsenen Ultralisken standhalten, aber worüber sich die Space-Marines am meisten freuen, ist die Tatsache, dass zum Inventar jetzt auch Stühle gehören.=16343
Skin/Info/BunkerSilver,Die Bunker von Tyrador sind mit Hochleistungsklimaanlagen ausgestattet, die den Wachdienst sogar in drückend heißen Tropengebieten zu einer komfortablen Angelegenheit machen. /// Tyrador's supercooled bunkers make for comfortable reconnaissance, even in sweltering tropical vacation zones.=16344
Skin/Info/Carrier,Diese beeindruckenden Großkampfschiffe schüren Hoffnung in den Herzen der Templer – oder Angst in denen ihrer Feinde. Dank der wendigen Interceptoren, die sie mit sich führen, können sie im Kampf schlachtentscheidend sein.=16345
Skin/Info/CarrierGolden,Eine kleine Anzahl Träger wurde mit Hilfe von uralten Verfahren umgerüstet, um ihren Vorgängern nach der Ära des Zwists zu ähneln. Sie werden hauptsächlich für diplomatische Missionen eingesetzt.=16346
Skin/Info/CarrierIhanrii,Der belebte Stein, der von den Ihan-rii-Protoss entwickelt wurde, ist leicht, widerstandsfähig und chemisch träge, was ihn zum idealen Baumaterial für riesige Raumträger macht. /// The animated stone developed by the Ihan-rii protoss is light, durable, and chemically inert, making it the perfect material for massive deep-space ships.=16347
Skin/Info/CarrierPurifier,Der Träger der Richter ist eine optimierte Schöpfung, die Erkenntnisse in der Automatisierung perfekt mit den tödlichsten aller Waffendrohnen kombiniert.=16348
Skin/Info/CarrierRemastered,Zu Ehren Tassadars und seines Opfers bauen die Protoss heute noch Träger, die dem legendären Flaggschiff Gantrithor nachempfunden sind.=16349
Skin/Info/CarrierTaldarim,Die Schiffsbauer der Tal'darim sind Meister darin, die Ingenieurskunst der Khalai zu Tötungszwecken umzufunktionieren. Die Trägerschiffe, die den Großteil der Todesflotte ausmachen, machen der Bezeichnung Kriegsschiff alle Ehre.=16350
Skin/Info/Carrier_AmonBrood_Collection,Amon ist es gelungen, einen Großteil der Goldenen Armada zu verderben und ihre Streitkräfte seinem Willen zu unterwerfen. Ebenso wie diese korrumpierten Protoss durch Leerenenergie deformiert wurden, ist auch ihren Schiffen Amons Einfluss anzusehen.=16351
Skin/Info/Colossus,Kolosse waren die ersten Roboter, die von den Protoss einzig zu Vernichtungszwecken entwickelt wurden. Sie sind ein Symbol eines blutigen Teils ihrer Geschichte aber auch eine notwendige Waffe, um eine friedliche Zukunft zu garantieren.=16352
Skin/Info/ColossusCE,Obwohl sie nach der Kalath-Interzession als zu gefährlich eingestuft wurden, wurden die Kolosse des Richter-Programms unter den Kriegern der Templer-Kaste zu Legenden. Sie sind die ultimativen Läuterungsmaschinen.=16353
Skin/Info/ColossusGolden,Einige Kolosse, die während des letzten Krieges gekämpft haben, wurden unter Verwendung der edelsten Materialien im traditionellen Stil umgebaut. Nun erinnern sie an die Protossroboter, die vor langer Zeit ein hohes Ansehen genossen.=16354
Skin/Info/ColossusIhanrii,Die vielen Steinkomponenten der Ihan-rii-Kolosse schweben frei. Sie werden zusammengehalten durch Leerenenergien, die wiederum von umfunktionierten Xel'Naga-Dynamos erzeugt werden. /// The many stone components of the Ihan-rii colossus are levitated and held together by void energies emanated from repurposed xel'naga dynamos.=16355
Skin/Info/ColossusPurifier,Die jüngsten Errungenschaften der Richter-Technologie haben zu einem schnittigen und auf subtile Weise verbesserten Koloss geführt, der trotz allem eine brutale Kriegsmaschine bleibt.=16356
Skin/Info/ColossusTal,Als Relikte längst vergangener Kriege lagen die Kolosse lange im gesamten Sektor begraben und vergessen. Nicht selten wurden einige von ihnen von Aspiranten der Tal'darim aufgespürt und reaktiviert, um sich ihre überlegene Feuerkraft zu sichern.=16357
Skin/Info/ColossusTaldarim,Niedrigrangige Aspiranten fordern sich oft gegenseitig heraus, einen aktiven Koloss zu kapern und umzuprogrammieren. Wenn es ihnen gelingt, erhalten die Tal'darim eine mächtige, neue Kriegsmaschine. Und falls nicht, dann haben die Aspiranten einen Konkurrenten weniger.=16358
Skin/Info/CommandCenter,Kommandozentralen sind mobile und praktische Ressourcenverarbeitungsanlagen, die überall hin verlegt werden können, wo es reichlich Mineralien und Vespingas gibt.=16359
Skin/Info/CommandCenterCovertOps,Die verstärkten Repulsor-Klauen dieser Kommandozentrale helfen ihr, auch in den unwirtlichsten Umgebungen festen Halt zu fassen.=16360
Skin/Info/CommandCenterRemastered,Frühere Modelle der Kommandozentrale hatten eine ausfahrbare Schnittstelle zum Anschluss externer Erweiterungen. Sie wurden später durch interne Buchten ersetzt, um die Sicherheit zu erhöhen. /// Previous iterations of the command center had an extensible interface in order to connect with external add-ons. These were later replaced with internal bays for increased security.=16361
Skin/Info/CommandCenterSilver,Nach der Ankunft der Protoss der Ihan-rii wurden die Kommandozentralen von Tyrador zu Empfangshallen für diplomatische Gesandte aus dem gesamten Koprulu-Sektor, von denen jeder die Neuankömmlinge für seine jeweilige politische Agenda gewinnen wollte. /// After the arrival of the Ihan-rii protoss, Tyrador's command centers played host to diplomatic envoys from around the Koprulu Sector, each intent on recruiting the newcomers to their own specific political agenda.=16362
Skin/Info/Corruptor,Schänder fliegen dank eines biologisch erzeugten elektromagnetischen Feldes. Sie können einen Schwall Säure ausstoßen, der sich auch durch die robustesten Baumaterialien frisst.=16363
Skin/Info/CorruptorMecha,Anstelle von Sporen besitzen die mechanischen Schänder sich selbst replizierende Nanoorganismen, die darauf programmiert sind, die gleiche Funktion zu übernehmen.=16364
Skin/Info/CorruptorPrimal,Die ursprünglichen Schänder zeichnen sich dadurch aus, dass sie sowohl vom Schwarm als auch von den Urzerg Anpassungen erfahren haben. Letztere haben dickere Klauen und Panzer beigesteuert, um den Strapazen ihrer Nahrungsaufnahme besser zu entsprechen.=16365
Skin/Info/CorruptorRCZ,Nach dem Fall von Arcturus Mengsk wurde das Zerberus-Programm offiziell eingestellt. Die Initiative, die sich der neuralen Reprogrammierung verschrieben hatte, wurde im Untergrund jedoch fortgeführt und man begann, statt terranischer Soldaten Zerg als Versuchsobjekte zu benutzen. /// Driven underground after the fall of Arcturus Mengsk, the Cerberus Program evolved their neural reprogramming initiative, targeting zerg instead of terran soldiers.=16366
Skin/Info/CorruptorWebby,Gehärtete Stacheln und Schwimmhäute deuten üblicherweise auf einen marinen Hintergrund hin, doch die Schänder der Leviathan-Brut haben sich diese angeeignet, um in Umgebungen mit hoher Schwerkraft zu überleben.=16367
Skin/Info/CreepTumorMecha,Im Herzen der Kriechertumore, die von abtrünnigen Replika-Königinnen erschaffen werden, muss sich fortschrittliche Nanotechnologie verbergen. Eingehendere Untersuchungen scheitern jedoch daran, dass die Tumore zu Explosionen neigen, wenn man sie aufschneidet.=16368
Skin/Info/CyberneticsCore,Die Protoss sind bekannt dafür, ihre gefallenen Helden mit künstlichen Körpern zu verschmelzen, um sie ein weiteres Mal in glorreiche Schlachten entsenden zu können. Bei der Entwicklung dieser Technologie spielt der Kybernetik-Kern eine entscheidende Rolle.=16369
Skin/Info/CyberneticsCoreForged,Alle Kybernetik-Kerne haben die Möglichkeit, Organismen mit ausgefeilter Maschinerie zu verschmelzen. Der Unterschied bei den Tal'darim besteht darin, dass dieser Prozess unvorstellbar schmerzhaft ist.=16370
Skin/Info/CyberneticsCoreIhanrii,Die terranische Aufklärung entdeckte in Siedlungen der Ihan-rii ein Gebäude, das dem klassischen Kybernetik-Kern ähnelte. Diese Version produzierte jedoch eine völlig andere Art von Energie. /// Terran recon of Ihan-rii settlements yielded footage of a structure resembling the contemporary protoss cybernetics core, though the energies produced by the Ihan-rii version were wildly different.=16371
Skin/Info/Cyclone,Obwohl angedacht war, dass dieses mobile Angriffsfahrzeug vollautomatisch funktioniert, wurde es umkonzipiert, um einem Piloten Platz zu bieten. Denn schließlich kann nichts mit der Unberechenbarkeit eines menschlichen Fahrers mithalten.=16372
Skin/Info/CycloneCovertOps,Dieses Fahrzeug wurde ausgiebigen Umgestaltungen unterzogen, um die Manövrierfähigkeit bei Spezialeinsätzen zu verbessern. Zu den Anpassungen gehören freigelegte Ketten, die schwieriges Terrain und enge Räume leichter überwindbar machen.=16373
Skin/Info/CycloneJunker,Miras Söldner haben ihre Zyklone um einiges imposanter gemacht, mit zusätzlicher Plattenpanzerung und einer großzügigen Anzahl Stacheln. Weil sie es aber so halbherzig zusammengeschustert haben, ändert das nichts an ihrer Belastbarkeit.=16374
Skin/Info/CycloneSilver,Beim Angriff der Zerberus-Zerg auf Tyrador IX wurden auch Zyklone zur Verteidigung eingesetzt, die statt scharfer Waffen nur harmloses Feuerwerk aus einem nahe gelegenen Vergnügungspark mit sich führten. /// When the Cerberus zerg attacked Tyrador IX, a few cyclones sent to defend were still armed with harmless fireworks used for nightly amusement park displays.=16375
Skin/Info/CycloneUmojan,Nachahmung ist die aufrichtigste Art von Schmeichelei, heißt es. Wenn man dieser Logik folgt, dann sind diese umojanischen Zyklone ein in jeder Hinsicht gewaltiges Kompliment an den Erfindergeist der Terranischen Liga.=16376
Skin/Info/DarkShrine,Der Dunkle Schrein war einst ein Denkmal an die Unabhängigkeit der Nerazim. Nachdem sie sich jedoch wieder den Khalai angeschlossen hatten, wurde die Einrichtung zur Ausbildung Dunkler Templer umfunktioniert.=16377
Skin/Info/DarkShrineForged,Einzig und allein die Blutjäger, die Vollstrecker des grausamen Willens ihres Hochlords, wissen, was sich im Inneren der Dunklen Schreine der Tal'darim abspielt.=16378
Skin/Info/DarkShrineIhanrii,Die extrem heißen Abgase, die aus der Spitze des Dunklen Schreins der Ihan-rii austreten, lassen infernalische Temperaturen im Inneren vermuten. Die Thermalanalyse der Terraner zeigt allerdings, dass der belebte Stein der Außenhülle dem Gefrierpunkt nahe ist. /// The superheated fumes venting from the top of the Ihan-rii dark shrine suggest infernal internal temperatures, though terran thermal analysis indicates the animated stone exterior is near-freezing.=16379
Skin/Info/DarkTemplar,Als mächtige Psi-Krieger vom Stamm der Nerazim haben die Dunklen Templer gelernt, die Mächte der Leere zu manipulieren. Sie greifen aus den Schatten an, sind tödlich und geben niemals auf.=16380
Skin/Info/DarkTemplarGolden,Traditionalisten der Templer behaupten, sich mit einigen Nerazim angefreundet zu haben, und preisen diese als wahre Vertreter der Daelaam. Andere vermuten, sie seien bestochen worden.=16381
Skin/Info/DarkTemplarIhanrii,Schon früh in ihrer Ausbildung werden Ihan-rii-Protoss an einen Leerenkristall gebunden, der mit ihrer einzigartigen Psi-Signatur übereinstimmt. Wenn sie Volljährigkeit erreichen, wird dieser Kristall zu einer tödlichen Speerspitze geschliffen. /// Early in their training, Ihan-rii protoss are bound to a void crystal that resonates with their unique psionic signature. Once they reach adulthood, this crystal is sharpened into a deadly spearpoint.=16382
Skin/Info/DarkTemplarPurifier,Nach ihren Erfahrungen mit den Nerazim haben die Richter eine neue Variante des Vollstreckers entworfen, der die Kampfkünste der Dunklen Templer nachahmt.=16383
Skin/Info/DarkTemplarTaldarim,Die Gesellschaft der Tal'darim ist gnadenlos. Diejenigen, die als zu schwach erachtet werden, werden schonungslos von den Blutjägern gejagt und hingerichtet. Diese können ihre Beute ungesehen verfolgen.=16384
Skin/Info/Disruptor,Disruptoren wurden als Teil des Richter-Programms entwickelt und zählen zu den tödlichsten Waffen der Protoss. Ihr solaritbetriebenes Arsenal kann gewaltige Zerstörung anrichten.=16385
Skin/Info/DisruptorGolden,Ähnlich wie die Kolosse wurden auch die im letzten Krieg eingesetzten Disruptoren überholt und dienen nun als Erinnerung an die siegreichen Schlachten der Protoss. Vielleicht wird mit der Zeit die Erinnerung an ihre Verluste allmählich verblassen.=16386
Skin/Info/DisruptorIhanrii,Disruptoren der Ihan-rii beziehen grüne Energie direkt aus den Kristallkernen ihrer Großkampfschiffe. Alle biologischen Organismen, die mit dem zentralen Energiestrahl in Berührung kommen, werden verdampft. /// Ihan-rii disruptors draw crackling green energy directly from the crystal cores of their capital ships. Anything biological that makes contact with the central power conduit is promptly vaporized.=16387
Skin/Info/DisruptorPurifier,Cybros' neueste Disruptoren sind mit fortschrittlicher Panzerung und Softwareverbesserungen ausgestattet, die die fortwährende Verpflichtung zur Forschung widerspiegeln.=16388
Skin/Info/DisruptorTaldarim,Die Tal'darim belächeln die Waffenwahl der Daelaam oftmals, doch haben sie keine Zeit verloren, so viele Disruptoren wie möglich unter ihre Kontrolle zu bringen und umzufunktionieren. Ein derartiges Zerstörungspotenzial konnten sie einfach nicht ignorieren.=16389
Skin/Info/Drone,Der genetische Code der fleißigen und unbeirrbaren Drohnen enthält das Mutationspotenzial sämtlicher Zerg-Strukturen. Sie benötigen dazu lediglich Ressourcen und Kriecher, um die zusätzliche Biomasse bereitzustellen.=16390
Skin/Info/DroneBlizzcon17,Diese ungewöhliche Drohne schlüpfte mitten in verrostetem terranischem Schrott. Doch anstatt darunter zu leiden, hat sich ihr Fleisch angepasst und ist mit dem Altmetall verschmolzen.=16391
Skin/Info/DroneMecha,Projekt Replika begann ursprünglich mit der Konstruktion einer mechanischen Drohne, die für die Erprobung neuer Taktiken und Waffensysteme gedacht war. Nachdem man das Potenzial dieser Technologie erkannt hatte, wurde schnell mehr daraus.=16392
Skin/Info/DronePrimal,Urdrohnen finden sich oft in gefährlichen Situationen wieder, da stärkere Rudelmitglieder sie gerne mal als Futterquelle verwenden. =16393
Skin/Info/DroneRCZ,Wie bei allen Zerberus-Zergs wurde das Nervensystem dieser Drohne durch kybernetische Technologie ersetzt, was die volle Kontrolle ihrer Bewegung ermöglicht. /// Like the rest of the Cerberus zerg, this drone's nervous system has been replaced with cybernetic technology, enabling full musculoskeletal control.=16394
Skin/Info/DroneRemastered,Frühere Exemplare der Drohnen wiesen lebhaftere Farben auf und reagierten schneller aggressiv. Im Laufe der Jahre sind diese Eigenschaften jedoch Stück für Stück zurückgegangen.=16395
Skin/Info/DroneWebby,Giftige Flossenstrahlen sind ein universeller Abwehrmechanismus, der Raubfischen signalisiert, sich fernzuhalten. Andere Kreaturen kopieren diese tödliche Optik, um ungewollte Aggressoren abzuschrecken.=16396
Skin/Info/EngineeringBay,Die Terraner haben ihre Kapazitäten in Sachen Maschinenbau nach dem Brood War umfassend ausgeweitet. Aufgrund des erhöhten Personals und der Komplexität der verrichteten Arbeit wurde Maschinendocks die Flugerlaubnis entzogen.=16397
Skin/Info/EngineeringBayCovertOps,Experimentelle Maschinendocks erhöhen ihre Forschungsgeschwindigkeit, indem sie zwei rivalisierende K.I.s in einer Kampfsimulation aufeinander ansetzen.=16398
Skin/Info/EngineeringBaySilver,Ein Bereich jedes Maschinendocks der Wächter von Tyrador ist für die Entwicklung neuer Attraktionen für Vergnügungsparks vorgesehen. Diese Praxis wurde allerdings infolge des Angriffs der Zerberus-Zerg vorübergehend eingestellt. /// A portion of each Knights of Tyrador engineering bay is devoted to concocting new amusement park attractions, though this policy has been temporarily suspended in wake of the Cerberus zerg assault.=16399
Skin/Info/EvolutionChamber,In der Evolutionskammer werden Genstränge verschmolzen und verflochten und so Verbesserungen der Zerg-Armee herbeigeführt.=16400
Skin/Info/EvolutionChamberMecha,Wie andere Replika-Gebäude auch, besteht die Evolutionskammer aus einer flexiblen Polymerlegierung, die sich den wechselnden biomechanischen Prozessen im Inneren anpasst.=16401
Skin/Info/EvolutionChamberRCZ,Nach Monaten der Frustration bei den Biotechnikern von Zerberus wurde entdeckt, dass die hyperadaptiven Tendenzen der Evolutionskammer gebändigt werden konnten, indem man ihre Arterien mit Steuerungspheromonen vollpumpt. /// After months of frustration in the Cerberus bioengineering department, it was discovered that pumping an evolution chamber's arteries full of command pheromones could just about tame the structure's hyperadaptive tendencies.=16402
Skin/Info/Extractor,In dieser biologischen Struktur wird Vespingas buchstäblich verdaut und in kleinen Fleischsäcken wieder ausgeschieden. Diese Säcke lassen sich dann bequem von Drohnen abtransportieren.=16403
Skin/Info/ExtractorMecha,Planungsunterlagen belegen, dass die Extraktoren des Replika-Projekts ursprünglich nur für dekorative Zwecke gedacht waren. Wann sie sich zu funktionsfähigen Vespinanlagen gewandelt haben bleibt unklar.=16404
Skin/Info/ExtractorRCZ,Die Zerberus-Extraktoren pulsieren unablässig unter der Oberfläche von Tyrador IX, um jede Spur von Vespingas aus der Planetenkruste zu saugen und so weitere Ausbreitung zu ermöglichen. /// Cerberus extractors pulse unremittingly beneath Tyrador IX's surface, leeching every trace of vespene gas from the planet's crust to power further expansion.=16405
Skin/Info/Factory,Während des Zweiten Krieges wurden aus den Fabriken die Latrinen entfernt. Dank des zusätzlichen Platzes waren die Mechaniker in der Lage, die Belagerungstechnik vor Ort in die Panzer einzubauen.=16406
Skin/Info/FactoryCovertOps,Die Fabriken der Serie R36 umfassen robustere Verankerungen, einen verstärkten Unterboden sowie Lackierung mit kugelsicherer Farbe.=16407
Skin/Info/FactorySilver,Die Siedlungsverhandlungen zwischen den Protoss der Ihan-rii und der Führung von Tyrador IX erlitten einen schweren Rückschlag, als mehrere terranische Fabriken in einem umstrittenen Gebiet auf mysteriöse Weise explodierten und grün glühende Krater hinterließen. /// Settlement negotiations between the Ihan-rii protoss and Tyrador IX's leaders hit a snag when several terran factories in a disputed area mysteriously exploded, leaving glowing green craters.=16408
Skin/Info/FleetBeacon,Flottensignalgeber verstärken die Verbindung der Raumportale zur Psi-Matrix, was das Heranwarpen massiver Großkampfschiffe erst möglich macht.=16409
Skin/Info/FleetBeaconForged,Der Flottensignalgeber der Tal'darim forciert durch die Sphäre in seinem Zentrum derart große Mengen an Psi-Energie, dass jeder Phasenschmied davon abraten würde. Dadurch ermöglicht er die Teleportation massiver und schwer gepanzerter Kriegsschiffe.=16410
Skin/Info/FleetBeaconIhanrii,Nachdem sie endlich nach Arakyr zurückgekehrt waren, errichteten die Ihan-rii mächtige Flottensignalgeber, um die Tiefen des Weltalls nach weiteren Überlebenden ihrer uralten Zivilisation abzusuchen. /// Back on Arakyr at last, the Ihan-rii built powerful fleet beacons to scan the depths of space for other survivors of their ancient civilization.=16411
Skin/Info/FleetBeaconTaldarim,[ph] FleetBeaconTaldarim info=16412
Skin/Info/Forge,In der Schmiede arbeiten die Phasenschmiede unermüdlich daran, die Waffen, Rüstung und die Schiffe ihrer Brüder zu verbessern. Diese außergewöhnlichen Ingenieure werden erst ruhen, wenn Aiur endlich zurückerobert wurde.=16413
Skin/Info/ForgeForged,Im Inneren der Tal'darim-Schmieden werden gefangene Ingenieure der Khalai verhört, bis sie ihre technologischen Geheimnisse preisgeben.=16414
Skin/Info/ForgeIhanrii,Die Ihan-rii bauen Leerenkristalle aus Adern am Südpol von Arakyr ab und bewahren sie vakuumversiegelt in den tiefsten Kammern ihrer Schmieden auf. /// The Ihan-rii mine void crystals from veins along Arakyr's southern pole, storing them vacuum-sealed in their forges' deepest chambers.=16415
Skin/Info/ForgeTaldarim,[ph] ForgeTaldarim info=16416
Skin/Info/FusionCore,Die Prozesse im Fusionskern sind äußerst empfindlich. Wissenschaftler arbeiten dort mit Antimaterie und Nuklearenergie, um die Leistungsfähigkeit von Schweren Kreuzern zu verbessern.=16417
Skin/Info/FusionCoreCovertOps,Um die Schweren Kreuzer der neuen Moira-Klasse zu versorgen, wurde die Energieleistung des Fusionskerns vervierfacht, ohne dabei jedoch die ausgestoßene Hitzestrahlung zu erhöhen.=16418
Skin/Info/FusionCoreSilver,Die flüssigkeitsgekühlten Fusionskerne versorgen nicht nur die im Orbit stationierte Flotte Schwerer Kreuzer, sondern auch die Kasinos, Freizeitbäder und robotischen Massagesalons von Tyrador IX mit Energie. /// In addition to supporting the orbital battlecruiser fleet, liquid-cooled fusion cores provide most of the power for Tyrador IX's casinos, water parks, and robotic massage parlors.=16419
Skin/Info/Gateway,Nach dem Brood War bauten die Protoss die uralte Warptechnologie der Xel'Naga nach. Heute können Warpknoten Krieger in Sekundenschnelle zu weit entfernten Schlachtfeldern transportieren. /// Following the Brood War, the protoss reverse engineered the ancient warp technology of the xel'naga. Gateways can now transport warriors to distant battlefields within seconds.=16420
Skin/Info/GatewayForged,Die Warpknoten der Tal'darim können über noch größere Entfernungen Krieger heranwarpen als ihre Gegenstücke bei den Khalai. Das hat lediglich den Nachteil, dass die Passagiere hin und wieder während der Reise zerfetzt werden.=16421
Skin/Info/GatewayIhanrii,Das Verhältnis zwischen den beiden Spezies auf Tyrador IX wurde auf die bisher härteste Belastungsprobe gestellt, als ein terranischer Würdenträger während des Besuchs einer Siedlung der Ihan-rii einen Warpknoten berührte und augenblicklich (und unappetitlich) von einer Leerenenergie-Überladung atomisiert wurde. /// Interspecies relations on Tyrador IX faced their toughest test yet when a terran dignitary visiting an Ihan-rii settlement touched a gateway and was immediately (and messily) vaporized by excess void energies.=16422
Skin/Info/GatewayTaldarim,[ph] GatewayTaldarim info=16423
Skin/Info/Ghost,Ghosts sind die ultimative Geheimwaffe der Terraner und setzen im Kampfeinsatz neben ihren tödlichen Fähigkeiten auch ihr angeborenes psionisches Potenzial ein. Ihr Spezialgebiet ist das Infiltrieren gegnerischer Stellungen und das Ausschalten wichtiger Ziele.=16424
Skin/Info/GhostAcademy,Nach der Gründung der Terranischen Liga, ließ Mengsk das Ghost-Programm überarbeiten. Dabei wurden spezielle Ghost-Akademien mit angeschlossenen Nuklearsilos errichtet, um das psionische Potenzial in vollem Ausmaß erschließen zu können. /// After forming the Dominion, Mengsk sought to overhaul the ghost program. Dedicated ghost academies with attached nuclear silos were erected in order to fully harness this potential.=16425
Skin/Info/GhostAcademyCovertOps,Die neueren Ghost-Akademien unternehmen nun erste Schritte gegen die Strahlung, die aus den Nuklearsilos in die angrenzenden Ausbildungsräume dringt.=16426
Skin/Info/GhostAcademySilver,Als herauskam, dass Zerberus für die Invasion der ferngesteuerten Zerg verantwortlich war, heuerten die Wächter von Tyrador Ghost-Söldner an, um die Führungsebene des skrupellosen Unternehmens aufzuspüren und zu eliminieren. /// When it was discovered that Cerberus was responsible for the invasion of remote-control zerg, the Knights of Tyrador recruited mercenary ghosts to track down and assassinate the rogue corporation's leadership.=16427
Skin/Info/GhostCovertOps,Imperator Valerian hat in den jüngsten Jahren zahlreiche Änderungen am Ghost-Programm eingeleitet, die zu besseren und engagierteren Rekruten geführt haben, von denen viele jetzt aus freien Stücken dienen.=16428
Skin/Info/GhostEidolon,Nur wenige Ghosts überleben die Strapazen des Programms lange genug, um sich Veteranen nennen zu dürfen. Doch diejenigen, die es so weit bringen, erhalten Zugang zu den höchst exklusiven Eidolon-Anzügen.=16429
Skin/Info/GhostJunker,Trotz ihres Charismas hatte Mira Han immer Probleme, Ghosts für ihre Crew zu rekrutieren und dort zu halten. Vielleicht bevorzugen sie einfach ausgeklügeltere Ausrüstung, als schrottsammelnde Söldner sie zu bieten haben. =16430
Skin/Info/GhostNova,Jeder Ghost ist ein tödlicher Geheimagent, aber diejenigen, die ihre Ausbildung mit Bestnoten abschließen, sind die tödlichsten unter ihnen. Diese Elite-Killer sind zentraler Bestandteil unzähliger Geheimoperationen überall im Sektor.=16431
Skin/Info/GhostSilver,Elite-Ghosts dienen als Personenschützer für hochrangige Besucher von Tyrador. Ihre Visiere gehören nicht mehr zur Standardausrüstung, seitdem ein Rockstar auf Tournee sich mit den Worten beschwerte: "Die Masken machen mich total paranoid, Mann." /// Elite ghosts guard Tyrador's most valuable tourists. Their visors were discontinued after a visiting rock star complained that "the masks freak me out, man."=16432
Skin/Info/GhostUmojan,Diese Eliteeinheit mit dem Beinamen Schattenwache bewahrt nicht nur den Frieden auf dem Gebiet des Protektorats von Umoja, sondern auch dessen schmutzige Geheimnisse.=16433
Skin/Info/GreaterSpireMecha,Offiziellen Angaben zufolge waren Große Schösslinge niemals Teil des Replika-Projekts. Aufnahmen, die das Gegenteil zu belegen suchen, wurden von Behörden der Liga als aufwändige Fälschungen dementiert.=16434
Skin/Info/Hatchery,Jede Kolonie braucht ein Herzstück. Von der Verdauung von Mineralien über das Erschaffen von Larven bis hin zur Kriechererzeugung ist die Brutstätte der Ursprung und die Blaupause aller Zerg.=16435
Skin/Info/HatcheryMecha,Als die Brutstättenkopien des Replika-Projekts anfingen, auf mysteriöse Weise eine Substanz abzusondern, die von Kriecher nicht mehr unterschieden werden konnte, hatte die Projektleitung bereits mit weitaus größeren Problemen zu kämpfen.=16436
Skin/Info/HatcheryRCZ,Nachdem Zerberus sicher war, dass die Infiltration der unterirdischen Höhlensysteme von Tyrador IX unentdeckt geblieben war, begann das Unternehmen damit, ferngesteuerte Brutstätten in den ausgedehnten Lavatunneln des Planeten anzulegen. /// After verifying that their infiltration of Tyrador IX's subterranean environment had escaped detection, Cerberus began seeding the planet's extensive lava tubes with remote-operated hatcheries.=16437
Skin/Info/HatcheryRemastered,Während der Abwesenheit der Königin der Klingen kämpften die Brutmütter der Zerg um die Vorherrschaft. Jene, die zu schwach waren, wurden aus ihren Kolonien vertrieben und gingen zugrunde. Andere fanden verlassene, inaktive Brutstätten und begannen mit der Erschaffung neuer Bruten. /// The zerg broodmothers vied for dominance over one another in the absence of the Queen of Blades. Many of those who were weak were displaced from their colonies and perished. Others discovered abandoned, dormant hatcheries and set to work raising new broods.=16438
Skin/Info/Hellion,Hochgeschwindigkeits-Fahrzeuge mit ultraleichtem Fahrgestell, die Schaden durch schnelle Ausweichmanöver vermeiden. Sie eignen sich vor allem für schnelle Kommandomissionen und sind daher besonders bei Söldnern beliebt.=16439
Skin/Info/HellionCovertOps,Mit einem gewagten dreirädrigen Design ist dieser Hellion noch schnittiger und leichter zu steuern als das Standardmodell. Und wenn man den Piloten Glauben schenken darf, dann macht selbst das Fahren damit mehr Spaß.=16440
Skin/Info/HellionJunker,Diese ursprünglich für illegale Stockcar-Rennen auffrisierten Hellions erfreuen sich großer Beliebtheit bei den berüchtigten Schrottsammler-Gangs der Randwelten.=16441
Skin/Info/HellionJunkerMM,Diese Hellions wurden entworfen, um ihre Fahrer schnell aus brenzligen Situationen zu befördern und dabei noch gut auszusehen. Außerdem scheinen sie illegale Stim-Emitter zu haben, aber das würden die Söldner niemals zugeben.=16442
Skin/Info/HellionSilver,Die eleganten Chromfelgen des Tyrador-Hellions wurden in Zusammenarbeit mit dem ehemaligen Streetrace-Idol JJ Hyun entwickelt, der sich mittlerweile auch als Designer einen Namen gemacht hat. /// The stylish chrome rims on the Tyrador hellion were designed in collaboration with street racer-turned-fashion icon JJ Hyun.=16443
Skin/Info/HellionUmojan,Die umojanische Version des Hellions beeindruckt mit einer verbesserten Federung, zusätzlicher Panzerung und noch bequemeren Fahrersitzen.=16444
Skin/Info/HighTemplar,Die Hohen Templer sind die erfahrensten und verehrtesten Krieger der Protoss. Indem sie ihre psionischen Fähigkeiten bis auf ein ehrfurchtgebietendes Niveau perfektionieren, werden ihre Geister zu ihrer mächtigsten Waffe.=16445
Skin/Info/HighTemplarGolden,Die Hohen Templer der Shelak waren die ersten, die zu Ehren von Khas und seiner Schlüsselrolle bei der Wiedervereinigung der Templer klassische Rüstung trugen. Ihre Hingabe an die ruhmreiche Vergangenheit entspringt ihrer Furcht vor einer unsicheren Zukunft. =16446
Skin/Info/HighTemplarIhanrii,Als sie erkannten, dass sie die "Zeratul", deren Notrufsignal sie aus tiefer Stasis geweckt hatte, nicht erreichen konnten, brachen die Ihan-rii-Protoss auf in Richtung eines Systems, das sie vor langer Zeit einmal ihre Heimat genannt hatten. /// Unable to reach the "Zeratul" whose distress signal had wrested them from deep stasis, the Ihan-rii protoss made their way to the system that, long ago, they had called home. =16447
Skin/Info/HighTemplarPurifier,Nach endlosen Experimenten haben die Richter schließlich K.I.-Krieger perfektioniert, die über dieselben charakteristischen Fähigkeiten verfügen wie die Hohen Templer der Daelaam. Es heißt, Hierarch Artanis persönlich sei höchst beeindruckt.=16448
Skin/Info/HighTemplarTaldarim,Das Rak'Shir gibt den Tal'darim die Möglichkeit, in der Kette des Aufstiegs empor zu steigen. Jahrelanger Terrazinkonsum und der Verzehr der Essenz ihrer Unterlegenen macht die Aspiranten zu überaus mächtigen Kriegern.=16449
Skin/Info/HiveMecha,Die Ausweitung der Mutation mehrerer Baue des Replika-Projekts zu ausgewachsenen Schwarmstöcken hätte sicherlich eine rasche Untersuchung nach sich gezogen, wenn es zu dieser Zeit noch jemanden zum Untersuchen gegeben hätte.=16450
Skin/Info/Hydralisk,Die als Hydralisken bekannten Tötungsmaschinen haben eine derart kräftige Muskulatur, dass sie die Stacheln zwischen ihren Panzerplatten mit extrem hoher Geschwindigkeit abstoßen können. Dadurch durchdringen diese selbst Neostahl.=16451
Skin/Info/HydraliskDen,Die Zerg übernahmen die Struktur der friedfertigen Slothien und entwickelten sie zum Hydraliskenbau. Mit der Zeit hat dieser ein biologisches Exoskelett entwickelt, um sein Fleisch besser zu schützen.=16452
Skin/Info/HydraliskDenMecha,Nachforschungen konnten weder aufdecken, wofür die tödlichen Vanadium-Klingen am Hydraliskenbau angebracht worden waren, noch wer dafür verantwortlich war.=16453
Skin/Info/HydraliskDenRCZ,Das Einstellen der Invasion von Tyrador IX war nie eine Option für Zerberus, denn das Unternehmen muss seinen Investoren versprochene Ergebnisse wie etwa "+20% effizientere Hydraliskenproduktion unter Realbedingungen" demonstrieren. /// Abandoning the invasion of Tyrador IX was never an option for Cerberus, which needs to demonstrate metrics like "+20% hydralisk production efficiency in real-world scenarios" to earn out its funding agreements.=16454
Skin/Info/HydraliskMecha,Da die ersten Hydralisken-Prototypen sich als höchst gefährlich für ihre Entwickler erwiesen, beschloss man, bei der Montage statt Krallen stumpfe Klingen zu verwenden.=16455
Skin/Info/HydraliskNoxious,Obwohl die Gattung Toxilisk ursprünglich eine Weiterentwicklung des Ultralisken war, tritt sie mittlerweile auch bei Hydralisken auf. Diese Exemplare sind ebenso giftig wie ihre größeren Artgenossen und sehen ähnlich furchterregend aus.=16456
Skin/Info/HydraliskPrimal,Die Hydralisken des Schwarms wurden ohne langes Zögern in die Rudel der Urzerg integiert, wo sie viele ihrer ursprünglichen Eigenschaften bewahrt haben. Dies zeugt fraglos von ihrer herausragenden Entwicklung.=16457
Skin/Info/HydraliskRCZ,Während eines Staubsturms gelang es Zerberus-Hydralisken, die Verteidigungsstellungen von Neu-Canaan zu durchbrechen, weil ihre lumineszierenden Augen von den Verteidigern für die Scheinwerfer von Dünenbuggys gehalten wurden. /// Cerberus hydralisks penetrated New Canaan's defense perimeter during a dust storm, when their luminescent eyes were mistaken for dune buggy headlights.=16458
Skin/Info/HydraliskRemastered,Erste Entwicklungen des Hydralisken besaßen dünnere Stachel und einen furchteinflößenden farbigen Kamm. /// Earlier Hydralisk evolutions were characterized by slimmer spikes and an imposing, colorful crest.=16459
Skin/Info/HydraliskWebby,Die Hydralisken der Leviathan-Brut haben niemals die benötigten Gensequenzen verloren, um sich in Schleicher zu verwandeln. Mehr als das, Elemente des Aussehens der Schleicher sind direkt in ihre eigene DNS eingesponnen.=16460
Skin/Info/Immortal,Wenn hochdekorierte Helden der Protoss im Kampf fallen, werden ihre Überreste oft in robotische Exoskelette transplantiert. Diese schwer gepanzerten und bewaffneten Unsterblichen gehören zu den loyalsten Kriegern der Protoss.=16461
Skin/Info/ImmortalAdun,Für einen Protoss gibt es keine größere Ehre als Selbstaufopferung. Niemand hat das besser verstanden als Adun, weshalb es auch nicht verwundert, dass die Unsterblichen seinem Namen gewidmet sind.=16462
Skin/Info/ImmortalGolden,Nach dem letzten Krieg wurden einige gefallene Templer dazu auserwählt, in klassische Unsterblichen-Exoskelette integriert zu werden. Sie zeigen damit ihre Hingabe an die Ideale, die die Protoss in schweren Zeiten vereint haben.=16463
Skin/Info/ImmortalIhanrii,Helden der Ihan-rii, die ehrenvoll im Kampf gefallen sind, werden in vierfüßigen robotischen Sarkophagen mit gewaltigen Kanonen begraben, die ihre Überreste in zukünftige Schlachten tragen. /// Ihan-rii heroes who die honorably are interred in four-legged robotic sarcophagi, which carry their remains to future battles, armed with tremendous cannons.=16464
Skin/Info/ImmortalPurifier,Nach dem Ende des letzten Krieges konnten die Richter die Hüllen gefallener Unsterblicher umfunktionieren, sodass sie jetzt als rein robotische Krieger fungieren.=16465
Skin/Info/ImmortalTaldarim,In Ungnade gefallene Tal'darim werden in einen Kampfläufer gesperrt und erhalten eine letzte Chance, ihre Schande zu tilgen. Sie hoffen, mit ihrem Tod dem Hochlord ein letztes Mal von Nutzen sein zu dürfen.=16466
Skin/Info/InfestationPit,In der Verseuchergrube wird der Genetik freier Lauf gelassen. Dort wird eine riesige Bandbreite an Seuchen, Krankheitserregern und Neuralparasiten gezüchtet. Und nur die effizientesten dieser Infektionen kommen bei den Verseuchern zum Einsatz.=16467
Skin/Info/InfestationPitMecha,Die ersten Anzeichen auf eine Fehlfunktion in der K.I. des Replika-Projekts zeigten sich, als die Verseuchergrube nicht mehr auf ihre Wartungstechniker reagierte.=16468
Skin/Info/InfestationPitRCZ,Neuralparasiten aus strategisch verteilten Verseuchergruben stellen sicher, dass abenteuerlustige Höhlenforscher, die zufällig auf einen der von Zerberus genutzten Lavatunnel stoßen, technische Schwierigkeiten melden und anschließend für immer verschwinden. /// Neural parasites from judiciously distributed infestation pits ensure that any adventurous spelunkers who happen across Cerberus-occupied lava tubes report technical difficulties, then are never heard from again.=16469
Skin/Info/Infestor,Getreu ihres Namens verbreiten die Verseucher den Einfluss des Schwarms, wo sie gehen und stehen. Organismen, denen der Neuralparasit eines Verseuchers eingepflanzt wird, werden zu willenlosen Soldaten der Zerg.=16470
Skin/Info/InfestorMecha,Forscher arbeiteten lange vergeblich daran, die Neuralparasiten des Verseuchers mithilfe einer KI zu replizieren. Erst als die Verseucher aus der Produktion genommen wurden, begann die KI plötzlich fehlerlos zu funktionieren.=16471
Skin/Info/InfestorPrimal,Da sie oft Ziel größerer, gefährlicherer Rudelmitglieder werden, haben die Urverseucher zu ihrem Schutz einen dicken Panzer entwickelt.=16472
Skin/Info/InfestorRCZ,Auf Wunsch eines besonders wichtigen Kunden ließ Zerberus den Verseucher mit einer Titanstruktur ausrüsten, um bekannte Schwachstellen zu verstärken. /// In response to feedback from an important corporate client, Cerberus implanted the notoriously fragile infestor with supportive titanium infrastructure.=16473
Skin/Info/InfestorWebby,Als Staatstiere übernehmen die Lebewesen, die die Borborumatriarchin bilden viele verschiedene Funktionen. Bei den Verseuchern der Leviathan-Brut sind die Abwehrstrukturen des Grundorganismus besser ausgebildet.=16474
Skin/Info/LairMecha,Als die erste Brutstätte des Replika-Projekts zu einem Bau mutierte, wurde eine Untersuchung angeordnet, jedoch war der verantwortliche Techniker gänzlich unauffindbar.=16475
Skin/Info/Larva,Diese unscheinbaren, madenähnlichen Organismen haben eine überraschend harte Hülle und können zu unzähligen Schreckenskreaturen mutieren.=16476
Skin/Info/LarvaMecha,Visuelle Wiedererkennbarkeit unter Replika-Einheiten wird oft als Grund genannt, warum Mecha-Larven entworfen wurden, die ihren Vorbildern in Form und Bewegung gleichen. Das erklärt jedoch nicht, warum die Ingenieure des Replika-Projekts es für notwendig hielten, auch die bekannten Schmatzgeräusche zu replizieren.=16477
Skin/Info/LarvaRCZ,Zerberus investierte viel Zeit und Mühe in die Zuordnung einzigartiger und meist schmerzhafter Reize zu bestimmten Metamorphosen der Zerg-Larven. /// Cerberus invested a great deal of effort in mapping unique and often painful stimuli to the metamorphoses of the zerg larva in which they resulted.=16478
Skin/Info/Liberator,Falken wurden von den Walküren des VED inspiriert und waren ursprünglich zur Luftabwehr konzipiert. Seit sie mit entsprechender Artillerie aufgerüstet wurden, können sie sich auch um Ziele am Boden kümmern.=16479
Skin/Info/LiberatorCovertOps,Jüngste Fortschritte im Neostahlbau haben zu einem komplexeren Panzerplattendesign geführt, das den Transformationsprozess von Falken verbessert. Die neidischen Blicke der restlichen Liga-Flotte sind ihnen sicher.=16480
Skin/Info/LiberatorJunker,Mira Han gewann all ihre Falken in einer einzigen dramatischen Partie Poker. Leider verlor sie sie schon kurze Zeit danach wieder an einen anderen Söldner.=16481
Skin/Info/LiberatorSilver,Falken auf Tyrador IX sind mit zahlreichen vorwärts gerichteten Flutlichtern ausgerüstet, um bei nächtlichen Patrouillen in der atemberaubenden Wildnis des Planeten die Sichtweite zu erhöhen. /// Liberators on Tyrador IX are equipped with numerous front-facing floodlights, increasing visibility during late-night patrols of the planet's stunning wilderness. =16482
Skin/Info/LiberatorUmojan,Es dauerte nur wenige Jahre, bis das Protektorat von Umoja seine eigene Version des Falken herausbrachte. Die Schubdüsen wurden komplett überarbeitet und sorgen für Neid bei den Konstrukteuren der Terranischen Liga.=16483
Skin/Info/Lurker,Die Schleicher galten als verloren, bis ihre Gensequenzen von einem wilden Schwarmcluster wiedererlangt werden konnten. Jetzt dienen sie erneut dem Schwarm und vernichten ihre Feinde aus dem Untergrund heraus.=16484
Skin/Info/LurkerDen,Von Weitem scheint der Schleicherbau mehr aus Knochen als aus Fleisch zu bestehen. Aus der Nähe sieht man aber, dass die Außenhülle eher an dickes, furchiges Leder erinnert.=16485
Skin/Info/LurkerDenMecha,Die Herstellung von Schleicherstacheln mit Nanospitzen erzeugt enorme Hitze, die vom Schleicherbau über ein ausgeklügeltes System aus Lüftungsschächten und Kühlsegeln abgeleitet wird.=16486
Skin/Info/LurkerDenRCZ,Um vorgelagerte Beobachtungsposten und eine verborgene erste Verteidigungslinie zur Verfügung zu haben, produzierte Zerberus zur Unterstützung der Verseuchung von Tyrador IX eine Vielzahl von Schleicherbauen. /// Anticipating the need for advance lookouts and a stealthy first line of defense, Cerberus produced an abundance of lurker dens to support their infestation of Tyrador IX.=16487
Skin/Info/LurkerMecha,Langwierige unterirdische Versuche führten zur Entwicklung eines brauchbaren mechanisierten Schleichers. Bei dem künstlichen Modell wurden allerdings die Stacheln verbessert, um leichter den Erdboden durchdringen zu können.=16488
Skin/Info/LurkerPrimal,Einige der Urhydralisken haben Mutationen entwickelt, bei denen sich mehr und mehr Charakteristiken der Schleicher herausbilden. Mittlerweile ähneln sie den Schleichern mehr als den Hydralisken, von denen sie eigentlich abstammen.=16489
Skin/Info/LurkerRCZ,Eine Kompanie von Ihan-rii-Protoss mit dem Auftrag, die Oberfläche von Tyrador IX zu untersuchen, wurde aufgerieben von Zerberus-Schleichern, die sich in der Landezone eingegraben hatten. /// A company of Ihan-rii protoss dispatched to investigate the surface of Tyrador IX were  massacred by Cerberus lurkers that happened to be burrowed at the landing site.=16490
Skin/Info/LurkerWebby,Die inhärente Verbindung des Hydralisken mit dem Schleicher in der Leviathan-Brut sucht im Schwarm seinesgleichen. Deshalb bringt ihre Metamorphose eine deutlich erhöhte Anzahl an Stacheln auf ihrer Seismischen Wirbelsäule hervor.=16491
Skin/Info/Marauder,Marodeure sind wandelnde Kampfmaschinen, die von der Liga zur Bekämpfung der Zerg mit ihrem gehärteten Panzer konzipiert wurden. Ihre Granaten sind jedoch gegen eine Vielzahl anderer Ziele effektiv.=16492
Skin/Info/MarauderCovertOps,Die Spezialkräfte der Liga haben bei ihrem Personal eine Umfrage durchgeführt, wie man die Anzüge der Marodeure noch verbessern könnte. Die überwiegende Antwort war: größere Waffen. Da ließen sich die Waffenentwickler nicht lange bitten.=16493
Skin/Info/MarauderDeluxe,Die neueste Weiterentwicklung des schweren Kampfanzugs CMC-660 wurde für freiwillige Feldversuche freigegeben. Glücklicherweise fehlt es dem Corps nicht an Marodeuren, die sich ein paar Extra-Credits verdienen möchten.=16494
Skin/Info/MarauderJunker,Diese Marodeure sind ein Teil der Gründungsmitglieder von Miras Crew und somit ungewöhnlich loyal verglichen mit anderen Individuen in der Söldnerwelt. Entweder das oder Mira hat ihnen gegenüber ein äußerst überzeugendes Druckmittel ...=16495
Skin/Info/MarauderSilver,Der Tyrador-Marodeur wiegt fast zweimal so viel wie ein Marodeur der Liga. Um das zusätzliche Gewicht auszugleichen, wurden die Hydraulik und die Wärmeabführung verbessert. /// The Tyrador marauder weighs almost twice the Dominion standard. Engineers compensated for the extra density with enhanced hydraulics and exhaust.=16496
Skin/Info/MarauderUmojan,Im Rahmen der Konstruktionsverbesserung wurde der CMC-Kampfanzug im oberen Segment zusätzlich verstärkt, um großkalibrige Granatwerfer einsetzen zu können. Verbesserte Nachtsichtgeräte sollen den umojanischen Marodeuren außerdem einen Vorteil im Kampf verschaffen.=16497
Skin/Info/Marine,Space-Marines sind die erste Verteidigungslinie für terranische Welten überall im Sektor. Diese kampfgestählte Truppe, in deren Reihen Sträflinge, Rebellen und Patrioten Seite an Seite kämpfen, ist stets bereit, sich in die Schlacht zu stürzen.=16498
Skin/Info/MarineCovertOps,Auch wenn nicht jedem eine lange Dienstzeit bei den Spezialkräften der Liga beschert ist, sind sich doch alle Marines einig, dass in diesem Beruf zumindest keine Langeweile aufkommt.=16499
Skin/Info/MarineJunker,Wer sich fragt, warum diese Söldner Klingen an ihren Waffen tragen, hat sich wohl noch nie in einer düsteren Spelunke mit ihnen geprügelt.=16500
Skin/Info/MarineRemastered,Unter Space-Marines, die im sogenannten Brood War gekämpft haben, ist die Panzerung von damals mit einer gewissen Nostalgie verbunden. Die landläufige Meinung ist, dass diese sehr viel bequemer war als die moderne Panzerung. /// Marines who fought in the Brood War often express nostalgia for the armor they wore back then, which they claim was significantly more comfortable.=16501
Skin/Info/MarineSilver,Die als Söldner angeheuerten Space-Marines, die Tyradors Erholungsgebiete und Strände bewachen, sind größtenteils kampfgestählte Veteranen, angelockt von scheinbar leicht verdientem Geld. /// The mercenary marines who guard Tyrador's resorts and beaches are mostly grizzled veterans lured to the system by the promise of an easy gig and generous pay.=16502
Skin/Info/MarineUmojan,Umojanische Space-Marines haben kürzlich Anzüge mit verstärkter Panzerung erhalten. Offiziell soll diese Maßnahme für mehr Sicherheit sorgen und die durchschnittliche Einsatzzeit von Rekruten verlängern. Manche Beobachter werten diesen Schritt jedoch als Vorbereitung auf zukünftige Konflikte.=16503
Skin/Info/MarineXPR,Auch wenn sie einen Ruf als Säufer und Krawallbrüder genießen, zählen die War Pigs doch zu den zuverlässigsten Söldnern im Sektor. =16504
Skin/Info/Medivac,Medivacs dienen sowohl als Landefrachter als auch als Krankenstation, wodurch gleichzeitig die Verlegung und die medizinische Versorgung von Truppen gewährleistet werden kann. So gelangen verwundete Soldaten schnell wieder an die Front.=16505
Skin/Info/MedivacCovertOps,Als Antwort auf die hohen Verluste während einer der jüngsten Geheimmissionen hat die Führung der Liga beschlossen, dass zukünftig auf einer größeren Anzahl an Missionen Medivacs zum Einsatz kommen, mit dem Ziel, die Verlustzahlen zu reduzieren.=16506
Skin/Info/MedivacJunker,Söldner sind zwar daran gewöhnt, im Kampf öfter mal den Kopf hinhalten zu müssen, doch gibt es hin und wieder Missionen, bei denen das Personal wichtig genug ist, damit eines dieser aufgemotzten Medivacs zum Einsatz kommt.=16507
Skin/Info/MedivacSilver,Die Medivacs auf Tyrador IX werden zwar von erfahrenen Piloten geflogen, sie werden aber meist nur eingesetzt, um reiche Touristen zu retten, die mit ihren Luxusyachten auf den tückischen Riffen des Smaragdmeers aufgelaufen sind. /// Though staffed by experienced pilots, medivacs on Tyrador IX are mostly used to rescue wealthy tourists who wreck their luxury yachts on reefs in the emerald seas.=16508
Skin/Info/MedivacUmojan,Der Fakt, dass die Lebensspanne von umojanischen Soldaten deutlich über dem Durchschnitt liegt, ist größtenteils auf die umfassende medizinische Ausbildung seiner Medivac-Piloten zurückzuführen.=16509
Skin/Info/MissileTurret,Auch wenn diese Verteidigungsgebäude recht fehleranfällig sein mögen, so machen sie doch meist kurzen Prozess mit fliegenden Angreifern. Außerdem können sie getarnte Feinde aufspüren.=16510
Skin/Info/MissileTurretCovertOps,Dank ihres schnittigen und unauffälligen Designs bleiben die Raketentürme der Spezialkräfte für feindliche Schiffe meist unbemerkt, bis sie sich in unmittelbarer Angriffsreichweite befinden.=16511
Skin/Info/MissileTurretSilver,Die Ihan-rii behaupten zwar, ihre schnell wachsende Phasengleiterflotte diene allein zeremoniellen Zwecken, aber die Wächter von Tyrador haben vorsichtshalber begonnen, ihr Netzwerk von Raketentürmen massiv auszubauen. /// Though the Ihan-rii claim their fast-growing void ray fleet is intended for ceremonial purposes only, the Knights of Tyrador have begun a massive expansion of their missile turret network just in case.=16512
Skin/Info/Mothership,Mutterschiffe sind die ultimativen Protoss-Kampfschiffe. Sie dienen als interstellare Kommandozentralen und können ganz allein den Ausgang einer Schlacht entscheiden. Deshalb sind sie die Flaggschiffe der Goldenen Armada.=16513
Skin/Info/MothershipGolden,Mutterschiffe wurden schon immer sorgfältig gewartet und regelmäßig modernisiert, aber seit der Rückbesinnung auf das Goldene Zeitalter der Templer ist die Faszination für diese gewaltigen Schiffe so groß wie noch nie.=16514
Skin/Info/MothershipIhanrii,Die Ihan-rii-Protoss sehen sich als die einzig wahren Nachfahren der Xel'Naga. Dieses Selbstverständnis unterstreichen auch die Runen, die ihre Mutterschiffe zieren. /// The Ihan-rii protoss believe themselves to be the only true descendants of the xel'naga, a message they convey proudly in the runes that adorn their motherships. =16515
Skin/Info/MothershipPurifier,Damit sie sich gegenüber den Templern als gleichwertig präsentieren können, haben die Richter begonnen, ihre eigenen riesigen Mutterschiffe zu konstruieren.=16516
Skin/Info/MothershipTaldarim,Die Mutterschiffe der Todesflotte sind bestens gerüstet, um das Schlachtfeld gänzlich zu dominieren. Jedes dient einem Flottengebieter der Tal'darim als Thron, während er die Vernichtung der Feinde beaufsichtigt.=16517
Skin/Info/Mutalisk,Nur wenige Dinge sind furchteinflößender als ein Himmel, der durch die Schwingen von Mutalisken verdunkelt wird. Die parasitären Sporenwürmer, die von ihnen ausgestoßen werden, können vom Himmel aus ganze Armeen niedermähen.=16518
Skin/Info/MutaliskMecha,Bei den mechanisierten Mutalisken gab es zunächst Probleme mit dem Gewicht, die jedoch erfolgreich behoben wurden. Seitdem gibt es zahlreiche Interessenten für diesen Prototyp – einige von ihnen mit Motiven jenseits einer wissenschaftlichen Anwendung.=16519
Skin/Info/MutaliskPrimal,Urmutalisken entwickeln sich immer weiter, insbesondere bei ihren Flügeln und Schwanzpartien. Diese Gattung hat zusätzlich eine gedämpfte Farbgebung, die es ihr erlaubt, in vielen unterschiedlichen Umgebungen unterzutauchen.=16520
Skin/Info/MutaliskRCZ,Bei der Invasion von Tyrador IX ließen Schwärme von Zerberus-Mutalisken den unerfahrenen Viking-Piloten keine Chance. Als aber die Ihan-rii-Protoss in uralten Steinschiffen landeten, sahen die Zerberus-Zerg sich einem weit gefährlicheren Gegner gegenüber. /// Swarms of Cerberus mutalisks outmaneuvered the inexperienced viking pilots defending Tyrador IX, but they faced a tougher foe when the Ihan-rii protoss descended in ancient stone ships.=16521
Skin/Info/MutaliskWebby,Mutalisken stellen den Großteil der Streitkräfte der Leviathan-Brut dar. Es heißt, sie agieren im Kampf als gedankenverbundene Einheit, als eine einzelne unnachgiebige Masse, die den Himmel verdunkelt.=16522
Skin/Info/Nexus,Der Nexus dient den Protoss beim Zugriff auf die Psi-Matrix in der ganzen Galaxie als Ankerpunkt. Jüngste technologische Fortschritte ermöglichen es, den Nexus auch als Fokuspunkt zur Manipulation der Raumzeit zu nutzen.=16523
Skin/Info/NexusForged,Vor langer Zeit bauten die Tal'darim einen eroberten Nexus der Khalai um, um maximale Brutalität aus seiner Architektur herauszuholen. Dabei wurde ein überladener Khaydarin-Kristall auf der Spitze eingesetzt, der nur von psionischen Krappen gebändigt werden kann.=16524
Skin/Info/NexusIhanrii,Die Ihan-rii empfangen terranische Delegationen in ihren Siedlungen, aber niemals innerhalb ihrer beeindruckenden Steinnexus, von denen seltsame Heullaute und dumpfe Geräusche wie von einem Herzschlag ausgehen. /// The Ihan-rii welcome terran delegations into their settlements, but never inside their imposing stone nexuses, from which strange ululations and distant heartbeat-sounds emanate.=16525
Skin/Info/NexusRemastered,Nach dem Brood War widmete sich eine große Zahl an Phasenschmieden der Daelaam der Modernisierung alter Nexus mit der neuesten Zeitverzerrungstechnologie. /// Following the Brood War, the Daelaam dedicated a great many phase-smiths to retrofit older nexuses with the latest chronal distortion technology.=16526
Skin/Info/NydusNetwork,Das Nydusnetzwerk ist das Resultat aus Nyduskanälen und dem Verlangen von Brutmüttern, Feinde mit Überraschungsangriffen zu überrennen. Wenn gewisse chemische Stimulanzien aktiviert werden, formt das Nydusnetzwerk unterirdische Tunnel auf dem gesamten Schlachtfeld.=16527
Skin/Info/NydusNetworkMecha,Eine Scannersuche nach der Einstellung des Replika-Projekts offenbarte ein verschachteltes Netzwerk aus nicht genehmigten Nydustunneln, die die ganze Einrichtung durchziehen.=16528
Skin/Info/NydusNetworkRCZ,Mit ferngesteuerten Nydusnetzwerken soll sichergestellt werden, dass die zweite Invasion von Tyrador IX aus allen Richtungen gleichzeitig erfolgt und somit Ergebnisse erzielt, die den Vorstand von Zerberus zufriedenstellen. /// Remote-operated nydus networks ensure that the second invasion of Tyrador IX will come from everywhere at once, hopefully facilitating an outcome more palatable to the Cerberus executive board.=16529
Skin/Info/NydusWormMecha,Auch wenn den Nyduswürmern des Replika-Projekts die unzerstörbare Muskelstruktur der Originale fehlen mag, ist immerhin der Geruch in ihrem Inneren doch um einiges angenehmer.=16530
Skin/Info/Observer,Komplexe Sensormatrizen erlauben den Beobachtern, massive Datenmengen in sehr kurzer Zeit anzuhäufen. Die kritischen Informationen, die sie dabei sammeln, haben nicht selten das Blatt einer Schlacht gewendet.=16531
Skin/Info/ObserverGolden,Alte Beobachter wiesen eine andere Stabilisatorenkonfiguration auf, die ihnen bei gleicher Effizienz ein imposanteres Aussehen verlieh. Manche Phasenschmiede behaupten, dass sich dadurch auch die Leistung verbessert, aber das ist nicht bewiesen.=16532
Skin/Info/ObserverIhanrii,Seit Jahrtausenden entsenden die Ihan-rii Beobachter, um die anderen Protoss-Sekten und die Zerg diskret zu observieren, ohne Gefahr zu laufen, selbst entdeckt zu werden. /// For millennia, the Ihan-rii have deployed observers to monitor the other protoss sects and the zerg without concern of being discovered.=16533
Skin/Info/ObserverPurifier,Beobachter werden von den Streitkräften der Richter hochgeschätzt. Insbesondere Fenix weiß sie zu würdigen.=16534
Skin/Info/ObserverTaldarim,Aufklärung ist für effektive Täuschungsmanöver unabdingbar. Die gerissensten Aspiranten nutzen Beobachter ausgiebig, um die Feinde der Tal'darim auszuspionieren ... und nicht zuletzt auch einander.=16535
Skin/Info/Oracle,Während ihres langen Exils hatten die Nerazim viel Zeit, um mit neuen Technologien zu experimentieren. Die mobilen Orakel sind ein hervorragendes Beispiel dafür, welche spektakulären Durchbrüche bei derartigen Experimenten erzielt werden können.=16536
Skin/Info/OracleGolden,Traditionalisten der Templer verwenden immer noch Technologie der Nerazim und passen nur das Äußere an ihre Vorlieben an. Matriarchin Vorazun zieht es vor, sich zu diesen Praktiken nicht zu äußern. =16537
Skin/Info/OracleIhanrii,Die Ihan-rii entsandten Orakel, um den Schweren Kreuzer der Behemoth-Klasse zu untersuchen, der sich ihnen im Orbit um Tyrador IX näherte.=16538
Skin/Info/OraclePurifier,Obwohl die Konstruktion am Anfang große Herausforderungen aufwarf, haben es einige kluge Phasenschmiede geschafft, Schiffe zu entwickeln, die sich mit den Orakeln der Nerazim messen können.=16539
Skin/Info/OracleTaldarim,Die Tal'darim begehren schon lange das Wissen der Nerazim um die Meisterung der Zeit. Gestohlene Orakel werden von den Flottengebietern, denen sie gehören, aufs Sorgsamste bewacht.=16540
Skin/Info/OrbitalCommandCovertOps,Die hochmodernen Scanner dieser Satellitenzentrale machen die meisten Aufklärungsmissionen überflüssig, worüber sich besonders die niederen Dienstgrade freuen, da diese überlicherweise für das Auskundschaften des Feindes herhalten mussten.=16541
Skin/Info/OverSeerWebby,Die Overseer wurden zu Aufklärungszwecken gezüchtet. Die Flossen und Tentakel der Overseer der Leviathan-Brut erlauben ihnen, sich mühelos sowohl durch die Luft als auch durch Wasser zu bewegen.=16542
Skin/Info/Overlord,Overlords erfüllen eine wichtige Funktion in einem Schwarmcluster der Zerg, indem sie Kriecher verbreiten und psionische Befehle von einer Brutmutter an die weniger entwickelten Organismen unter ihrer Kontrolle übertragen. =16543
Skin/Info/OverlordMecha,Overlords zählten zu den ersten Modellen, die im Zuge von Projekt Replika gebaut wurden. Sie werden vorsichtig von einem Laborwissenschaftler gesteuert und sind dadurch eine wichtige Sicherheitskomponente des gesamten Forschungsprojekts. =16544
Skin/Info/OverlordPrimal,Einige Rudelführer der Urzerg, wie z. B. Dehaka, haben sich so weit entwickelt, dass sie keine Overlords benötigen. Ein paar wenige verbleiben jedoch als Überbleibsel der Vergangenheit.=16545
Skin/Info/OverlordRCZ,Zerberus-Overlords navigieren mithilfe von hell leuchtenden Energiesignalen, weshalb sie auch bei schlechten Sichtverhältnissen wie in den Staubstürmen und Nebelbänken auf Tyrador IX exakt ihre Position bestimmen können. /// Cerberus overlords use incandescent energy beacons to pinpoint positioning even in low-visibility conditions, like the dust storms and fog banks common on Tyrador IX.=16546
Skin/Info/OverlordWebby,Die Overlords üben die Kontrolle über die Diener des Schwarms aus. Eine der Auswirkungen dieser ständigen Verbindung ist, dass die Overlords der Leviathan-Brut die genetischen Mutationen der Kreaturen unter ihnen widerspiegeln.=16547
Skin/Info/OverlordXPR,Da sie mit so vielen verschiedenen Zerg-Gattungen gleichzeitig umgehen müssen, kommt es bei Overlords manchmal zu spontanen Anpassungsmutationen, mit denen sie versuchen, ihre eigene Effizienz zu erhöhen.=16548
Skin/Info/Overseer,Als Weiterentwicklung des Overlords konzentriert sich der Overseer auf die Aufklärung und das Aufspüren verborgener Feinde, egal wie gut sie sich verstecken.=16549
Skin/Info/OverseerMecha,Da man nicht in der Lage war, die organische Struktur der Augen des Overseers nachzuahmen, ließ der leitende Ingenieur sie durch Bewegungssensoren ersetzen, die mehr oder weniger den gleichen Zweck erfüllen. Zumindest, wenn man von der Ästhetik absieht.=16550
Skin/Info/OverseerPrimal,Zu den seltensten Gattungen der Urzerg zählen die Overseer. Wie ihre Gegenstücke im Schwarm haben auch sie sich aus Uroverlords entwickelt und beide verfügen über extrem geschärfte Sinne.=16551
Skin/Info/OverseerRCZ,Die Leerensensoren der Zerberus-Overseer wurden von einem gewissen Dr. Rudolfo Subsourian entwickelt. Mit ihrer Hilfe lässt sich in einem Umkreis von 20 Kilometern die exakte Position einer getarnten Einheit bestimmen. /// The Cerberus overseer's void sensor technology was developed by one Dr. Rudolfo Subsourian. It can triangulate the exact position of a cloaking effect within 20 kilometers.=16552
Skin/Info/Phoenix,Phönixe wurden für schnelle Störeinsätze konzipiert und sind berühmt für ihre Geschwindigkeit und Manövrierfähigkeit. Bereits eine kleine Gruppe Phönixe kann selbst eine zahlenmäßig weit überlegene feindliche Armee in Schach halten.=16553
Skin/Info/PhoenixGolden,Der Stamm der Shelak hat Phönix-Modelle entwickelt, die Eskortschiffen der frühen Judikatoren ähneln. Obwohl manche sie als kontroverse Symbole sehen, bewundern viele ihre elegante Ästhetik.=16554
Skin/Info/PhoenixIhanrii,Trotz ihrer Konstruktion aus Stein haben Ihan-rii-Phönixe nichts von ihrer Geschwindigkeit und Wendigkeit eingebüßt. Zusätzlich ist ihre Einschlagswirkung bei einer Bruchlandung noch verheerender. /// Though the Ihan-rii phoenix's stone construction doesn't inhibit its maneuverability or top speed, it does make it a more formidable missile when crash-landing.=16555
Skin/Info/PhoenixPurifier,Wenn die Richter nicht auf die Phasentechnologie der Mirages angewiesen sind, gewährleisten sie die Sicherheit ihrer Lufträume mit robotischen Phönixen.=16556
Skin/Info/PhoenixTaldarim,Manchmal benötigt man überwältigende Stärke und manchmal Schnelligkeit und tödliche Präzision. Die Tal'darim kennen den Wert beider Ansätze, weshalb sie ebenfalls eine Flotte Phönixe unterhalten, welche von den Templern gestohlen wurden.=16557
Skin/Info/PhotonCannon,Die Phasenschmiede der Protoss können ihre Verteidigungsgebäude mit mächtigen Antimateriekanonen und fortschrittlichen Detektorfunktionen nachrüsten. Experimente, Photonenkanonen mit Warptechnologie auszustatten, sind jedoch wiederholt gescheitert.=16558
Skin/Info/PhotonCannonForged,Trotz ihres strengen Kriegerkodex haben die Tal'darim kein Problem damit, insgeheim Photonenkanonen zu errichten, die Tod und Zerstörung auf feindliche Arbeiter niederregnen.=16559
Skin/Info/PhotonCannonIhanrii,Das Phasendisruptorgehäuse der Photonenkanone der Ihan-rii weist eine unverwechselbare Flügelform auf. Sie wurde von einer majestätischen gefiederten Kreatur inspiriert, die einst den Himmel von Tyrador IX beherrschte – bis sie von frühen terranischen Siedlern ausgerottet wurde. /// The phase disruptor housing of the Ihan-rii photon cannon features a distinctive wing-shape inspired by a majestic avian creature that once ruled Tyrador IX's skies, at least until it was hunted to extinction by early terran settlers.=16560
Skin/Info/PhotonCannonTaldarim,[ph] PhotonCannonTaldarim info=16561
Skin/Info/PlanetaryFortressCovertOps,Die neuesten Planetaren Festungen haben derart mächtige Kanonen, dass diese dreimal tiefer verankert werden müssen als gewöhnlich, nur um bei jedem Schuss dem Rückstoß standzuhalten.=16562
Skin/Info/Probe,Sonden wurden von den Khalai entworfen, um die Grundsteine für neue Protoss-Siedlungen zu legen. Sie sind autarke Roboter, die das Heranwarpen wichtiger vorgefertigter Gebäude einleiten können.=16563
Skin/Info/ProbeBlizzcon17,Diese Sonden wurden aus den Überresten einer zerstörten Protoss-Kolonie geborgen und von den Mitgliedern einer Schrottsammler-Gang mit terranischen Motoren und anderen Teilen umgerüstet. Das macht sie zumindest einzigartig.=16564
Skin/Info/ProbeGolden,Einige wenige Sonden aus der Periode nach der Ära des Zwists haben bis heute überlebt. Sie stammen aus einer Zeit, zu der selbst die einfachsten Protossmaschinen ein edles und formvollendetes Design aufwiesen.=16565
Skin/Info/ProbeIhanrii,Wenn die Ihan-rii sich in den Tiefen des Weltraums für längere Zeit in Stasis begeben, können ihre Sonden in praktische Würfel zusammengefaltet werden, um Platz zu sparen. /// When not in use during long periods of deep-space hibernation, Ihan-rii probes fold into perfect cubes for compact storage.=16566
Skin/Info/ProbePurifier,Diese Sonden sind ein Beispiel an Effizienz und Sorgfalt. Ihre Software wurde verbessert, um gänzlich in das Datennetz der Richter eingebunden werden zu können.=16567
Skin/Info/ProbeRemastered,Sonden aus der Ära des Großen Krieges hatten längere Stabilisatoren, doch die Phasenschmiede fanden schnell heraus, dass diese inmitten großer und hitziger Schlachten leicht zum Hindernis werden konnten.=16568
Skin/Info/ProbeTaldarim,Die Sonden der Daelaam sind so kalibriert, dass sie beim Ressourcenabbau die geringstmöglichen ökologischen Auswirkungen verursachen. Die Tal'darim hingegen haben keine Zeit für derartige Albernheiten.=16569
Skin/Info/Pylon,Als die Daelaam sich an den Wiederaufbau ihrer Zivilisation machten, war die Schaffung einer neuen Psi-Matrix ein wichtiger Teil dieser Anstrengungen. Der Khaydarin-Kristall im Inneren jedes Pylonen ermöglicht es den Protoss, die Energie der Matrix zu nutzen.=16570
Skin/Info/PylonForged,Jeder Tal'darim-Pylon ist mit genug Psi-Energie geladen, um bis zu sechzehn Warpknoten zu versorgen. /// Each Tal'darim pylon crackles with enough psionic energy to power sixteen gateways.=16571
Skin/Info/PylonIhanrii,Die Gebiete, die von den Ihan-rii wieder besiedelt wurden, werden von wachsenden Feldern leuchtender Pylonen in ein ätherisches Licht getaucht, das sogar vom Orbit aus sichtbar ist. /// Across areas of Tyrador IX recolonized by the Ihan-rii, proliferating fields of luminescent pylons produce an ethereal glow visible from orbit.=16572
Skin/Info/PylonTaldarim,[ph] PylonTaldarim info=16573
Skin/Info/PylonXPR,Das Khor-shakal war einst das Kronjuwel Aiurs, eine Stadt von solcher Herrlichkeit, dass sie jeder Beschreibung spottete. Selbst solch einfache Bauten wie Pylonen waren übersät mit leuchtenden Verzierungen.=16574
Skin/Info/Queen,Um die Zukunft des Schwarms zu gewährleisten, ließ Kerrigan eine neue Gattung von Königinnen erschaffen, die in der Lage sind, eigenständig zu denken und Situationen zu analysieren. Sie dienen als Meisterinnen der Bruten in einem sich ständig entwickelnden Schwarm.=16575
Skin/Info/QueenMecha,Die beeindruckende Königin war das erste Produktionsmodell, das nach der Fertigstellung verschwand. Da die Öffentlichkeit über ihre Tätigkeiten nichts wissen sollte, beschlossen die Leiter von Projekt Replika, diese Angelegenheit so diskret wie möglich zu untersuchen.=16576
Skin/Info/QueenPrimal,In den Rudeln der Urzerg gilt einzig das Recht des Stärkeren, deshalb nehmen Königinnen dort eine gänzliche andere Position ein als in traditionellen Bruten. Man sieht sie nur selten in großer Zahl.=16577
Skin/Info/QueenRCZ,Königinnen verteidigen die Zerberus-Front mit geschmiedeten Titanklingen, schubgestützten Stachelwerfern und Mutterinstinkten, die selbst eine neurologische Überholung nicht vollständig eliminieren konnte. /// Queens defend the Cerberus backline with forged titanium blades, jet-powered spine launchers, and matronly instincts even a neurological overhaul couldn't eliminate entirely. =16578
Skin/Info/QueenWebby,Selbst die Königinnen der Leviathan-Brut sind unglaublich bösartig und feindselig. Jedes Wesen, das dumm genug ist, sich ihrem Gelege mit bösen Absichten zu nähern, schließt schnell Bekanntschaft mit ihren vielen Stacheln.=16579
Skin/Info/Ravager,Verheerer sind Weiterentwicklungen von Schaben und das Ergebnis jahrelanger genetischer Modifikation. Sie sind in der Lage, in kürzester Zeit riesige Mengen an ätzender Galle zu erzeugen, die sie dann auf Feinde schleudern.=16580
Skin/Info/RavagerBone,Kalzifizierte Knochenplatten machen Zerg-Panzerung noch effektiver und haben außerdem den von Abathur geschätzten Nebeneffekt, bedrohlich zu wirken.=16581
Skin/Info/RavagerMecha,Bei den replizierten Verheerern ist das Ausstoßventil für Plasmafeuer mit hitzeabsorbierenden Platten abgedeckt, um den Rest des Modells vor Beschädigungen zu schützen.=16582
Skin/Info/RavagerPrimal,Urverheerer sind widerspenstig und blutrünstig. Sie verschlingen ihre eigenen Jungen, falls diese nicht stark genug sind, sich zur Wehr zu setzen. Wenn man dieses Verhalten betrachtet, ist es ungewiss, wie lange man diese Gattung noch beobachten kann.=16583
Skin/Info/RavagerRCZ,Die Plasmastacheln im Rücken der Zerberus-Verheerer heizen die ätzende Galle, die sie verschießen, auf extrem hohe Temperaturen auf. So konnten diese Verheerer auf Tyrador IX gewaltige Löcher in die Verteidigung der Terraner reißen. /// The plasma spines on the Cerberus ravager's back superheat the corrosive bile it fires. On Tyrador IX, these ravagers punched massive holes in the terran defense.=16584
Skin/Info/RavagerWebby,Voll ausgewachsene Verheerer sind ein schrecklicher Anblick, so monströs und gewaltig wie sie sind. Die mit Schwimmhäuten versehenen Albträume der Leviathan-Brut sind das beste Beispiel dafür.=16585
Skin/Info/Raven,Raven sind in der Aufklärung und Verteidigung unerlässlich. Sie können Geschütztürme und Verteidigungsdrohnen einsetzen sowie Raketen auf feindliche Streitkräfte feuern. Und als ob das nicht genug wäre, sind sie auch noch kosteneffizienter als ihre Vorgänger.=16586
Skin/Info/RavenCovertOps,Dieses Raumfahrzeug mit dem exquisiten Design ist der Stolz der Spezialkräfte der Liga. Gerüchte besagen, es könne sogar noch das Flüstern kel-morianischer Bergarbeiter zwei Kilometer unter der Oberfläche auffangen.=16587
Skin/Info/RavenJunker,Fortschrittliche Aufklärungsschiffe stehen bei Söldnern nicht wirklich weit oben auf der Liste. Doch unter all dem Rost und der abgeblätterten Farbe können sie immer noch mit denen der Liga mithalten.=16588
Skin/Info/RavenSilver,Als die Zerberus-Zerg drohten, die Verteidiger von Tyrador IX zu überwältigen, entdeckte ein hoch fliegender Raven eine Flotte mysteriöser Steinschiffe im Gravitationstopf des Planeten. /// As the Cerberus zerg threatened to overwhelm Tyrador IX's defenders, a high-altitude raven detected a fleet of strange stone ships in the planet's gravity well.=16589
Skin/Info/RavenUmojan,Diese hochmodernen Raven sind mit einer noch wenig erforschten künstlichen Intelligenz ausgestattet, die weit mehr Autonomie besitzt, als terranische Programmierer je zulassen würden.=16590
Skin/Info/Reactor,Bei der Erforschung der Eindämmungsfelder der Protoss gelang terranischen Wissenschaftlern ein Durchbruch, der schließlich die Produktionskapazitäten von Feldkommandanten verdoppelte.=16591
Skin/Info/ReactorCovertOps,Hochmoderne Reaktoren stehen der Energieleistung von Thor-Motoren in nichts mehr nach; lediglich bei ihrer Zuverlässigkeit gibt es noch marginale Unterschiede.=16592
Skin/Info/ReactorSilver,Präsidentensuites in 5-Sterne-Resorts von Tyrador IX sind mit einem eigenen Hochleistungsreaktor ausgestattet, um die komplexe Freizeitelektronik und -kybernetik zu versorgen, mit der die wohlhabendsten Gäste meist anreisen. /// Presidential suites in Tyrador IX's five-star resorts each come with their own military-grade reactor, in recognition of the complex recreational electronics and cybernetics the wealthiest guests tend to bring along.=16593
Skin/Info/Reaper,Rekruten, bei denen die Resozialisierung nicht wirkt, werden zu Rächern ausgebildet. Diese Schocktruppen sind extrem aggressiv und risikofreudig und erleben nur selten das Ende eines Einsatzes.=16594
Skin/Info/ReaperCovertOps,Infolge jüngster Reformen werden Rächer nun nicht mehr gezwungen, gefährliche Stimulanzien zu verwenden, um ihre Leistung zu steigern. Stattdessen werden im Rekrutierungsprozess jetzt Kandidaten bevorzugt, die von Natur aus unberechenbar sind.=16595
Skin/Info/ReaperJunker,Rächer gibt es bei Miras Marodeuren immer genug. Sie versuchen ständig, sich gegenseitig mit dem Aussehen ihrer zusammengebastelten Rüstung zu übertrumpfen. Die Irokesen spielen dabei eine ganz besondere Rolle.=16596
Skin/Info/ReaperSilver,Auf Tyrador IX wurde die Invasionsflotte der Zerberus-Zerg von einem Rächer entdeckt, der einen Umweg nach Hause gemacht hatte, um einem Staubsturm nahe Neu-Canaan auszuweichen. /// On Tyrador IX, an invasion force of Cerberus zerg was spotted by a reaper taking the long way home to avoid a dust storm near New Canaan.=16597
Skin/Info/ReaperUmojan,Mehrere Jahre lang hat das Protektorat von Umoja ehrgeizig daran gearbeitet, mit Hilfe psychologischer Eignungstests genug geeignete Kandidaten für eine eigene Rächer-Einheit zu rekrutieren. Mit überraschendem Erfolg.=16598
Skin/Info/Refinery,Die Raffinerie dient dazu, Vespingas in handliche Zylinder abzufüllen, die dann leicht von Weltraumbaufahrzeugen abtransportiert werden können.=16599
Skin/Info/RefineryCovertOps,Die Raffinerie der Spezialkräfte baut Vespingas exakt genauso schnell ab wie herkömmliche Modelle, verursacht dabei aber 75% weniger Lärm.=16600
Skin/Info/RefinerySilver,Trotz sorgfältiger Wartung sind die Vespingaserträge der Raffinerien von Tyrador IX seit dem Angriff von Zerberus zurückgegangen – als ob die unterirdischen Vorkommen auch von anderer Seite angezapft werden. /// Despite diligent maintenance, Tyrador IX's refineries have reported lower-than-average vespene yields since the Cerberus attack, as if the underground reservoirs they tap have been diverted.=16601
Skin/Info/Roach,Schaben wurden von der Königin der Klingen persönlich für die Assimilation in den Schwarm ausgewählt. Ihre beeindruckende Geweberegeneration und ihr ätzendes Gift machen sie ebenso widerstandsfähig wie tödlich.=16602
Skin/Info/RoachDeluxe,Auf Zagaras Anweisung hin experimentiert Abathur weiterhin mit dem Zerg-Genom auf der Suche nach Perfektion. Die regenerativen Fähigkeiten der Schabe machen sie zu einem idealen Kandidaten für dieses Unterfangen.=16603
Skin/Info/RoachMecha,Diese Maschinen sind mit einem hochmodernen, sich selbst reparierenden System ausgestattet, das die unglaublichen Selbstheilungsfähigkeiten der Schabe nachahmt und außerdem strukturelle Schäden durch seine Säurereserven bekämpft.=16604
Skin/Info/RoachPrimal,Schaben zählen zu den ersten, die in die Rudel der Urzerg auf Zerus aufgenommen wurden. Dort entwickelten sie dann die Fähigkeit, zu Urfeuerschaben und Urwächtern zu mutieren.=16605
Skin/Info/RoachRCZ,Zerberus-Wissenschaftler haben die bereits beeindruckende Panzerung der Schabe noch weiter verstärkt mit Nanogewebe aus Karbonfaser. Zusätzlich wurden geschmiedete Titanklingen nachgerüstet, um die offensiven Fähigkeiten der Schabe zu verbessern. /// Cerberus scientists bulwarked the roach's already-impressive armor with a carbon fiber nanoweave. Forged titanium blades were added to aid its offensive capabilities as well.=16606
Skin/Info/RoachWarren,Die Entwicklung von Schaben und Verheerern verlangt nach feuchten und lichtarmen Bedingungen. Die Schabenhöhle ist das perfekte lebende Organ, um diese Bedingungen zu gewährleisten.=16607
Skin/Info/RoachWarrenMecha,Es bedurfte einiger Innovation in Sachen Polymerlegierungen, um eine Hülle für die Replika-Schabenhöhle zu entwickeln, die dem Herstellungsprozess der Säure in ihrem Inneren gewachsen war.=16608
Skin/Info/RoachWarrenRCZ,Die von Zerberus angepassten Zerg-Strukturen wie die Schabenhöhle produzieren selbstreplizierende Blaupausen für Fernsteuerungsausrüstung, die während der Metamorphose der Larven installiert wird. /// Cerberus adaptations of zerg structures like the roach warren produce self-replicating blueprints for remote control equipment to be installed synchronous with larval development.=16609
Skin/Info/RoachWebby,Ähnlich wie ihre Vorfahren, die Zantarschnecken, demonstrieren Schaben unglaubliches Anpassungspotenzial. Vespineinfluss führt bei den Exemplaren der Leviathan-Brut zu extremer Aggressivität.=16610
Skin/Info/RoboticsBay,Das Roboterdock dient den führenden Phasenschmieden der Khalai als primäre Forschungs- und Entwicklungseinrichtung.=16611
Skin/Info/RoboticsBayForged,Terrazin-Dämpfe dringen aus der dunklen, unheilvollen Klaue, die den Tal'darim als Roboterdock dient.=16612
Skin/Info/RoboticsBayIhanrii,Die segmentierten Fertigungsarme des Roboterdocks der Ihan-rii arbeiten mit einer Geschwindigkeit und Flexibilität, die ihr steinernes Aussehen Lügen strafen. /// The segmented assembly arms of the Ihan-rii robotics bay move with flexibility and speed that belie their stone composition.=16613
Skin/Info/RoboticsFacility,Phasenschmiede benötigen große Hallen, um ihre enormen automatisierten Kriegsmaschinen heranzuwarpen, wie zum Beispiel die riesigen Kolosse. /// Phase-smiths require expansive facilities to warp in enormous war automatons, such as the colossus.=16614
Skin/Info/RoboticsFacilityForged,Ein gepanzerter Rumpf und schwere, verstärkte Anker verleihen der Roboterfabrik der Tal'darim ein imposantes Profil.=16615
Skin/Info/RoboticsFacilityIhanrii,Die Ihan-rii reagieren ausweichend auf Fragen zu ihren neuen Roboterfabriken, die nie stillzustehen scheinen und ununterbrochen schwer gepanzerte Einheiten ausspucken. /// The Ihan-rii have been evasive when questioned about the frenzied activity of their newly constructed robotics facilities, which churn out heavily armed units at all hours of the day and night.=16616

Skin/Info/SCV,Das Weltraumbaufahrzeug T-280 ist das A und O bei Bau- oder Reparaturarbeiten auf allen terranischen Welten. Seine Vielseitigkeit und seine Zuverlässigkeit machen das WBF zu einem unverzichtbaren Nutzfahrzeug.=16619
Skin/Info/SCVBlizzcon17,Auch die Schrottsammler kommen nicht umhin, Mineralien und Vespingas abzubauen. Dabei wollen sie dann aber zumindest so furchteinflößend wie möglich aussehen.=16620
Skin/Info/SCVCovertOps,Aufgrund der gehobenen Ansprüche in Geheimmissionen müssen selbst WBFs mit der neuesten Technologie ausgestattet werden, einschließlich eines stärkeren Allzweckgreifers und einer neuen Laserextraktionsklaue.=16621
Skin/Info/SCVJunker,Immer wieder haben manche WBF-Piloten der Terranischen Liga die Nase voll von schlechter Bezahlung und ewigen Überstunden und entscheiden sich für ein Leben als Söldner. Die wenigsten von ihnen bereuen diese Entscheidung jemals.=16622
Skin/Info/SCVRemastered,Die WBFs der Serie T-280 stammen noch aus der Zeit vor dem Brood War. Sie waren weniger sperrig mit kleineren Allzweckscheren und hatten - wenn man den Gerüchten glauben darf - sogar versteckte Becherhalter.=16623
Skin/Info/SCVSilver,Die Wächter von Tyrador entschieden sich beim Aufbau ihrer planetaren Verteidigungskräfte für eine Weiterentwicklung des WBFs mit Platin-Iridium-Legierung, um Kratzer und Abnutzungserscheinungen zu minimieren. /// When selecting armor for their planetary defense force, the Knights of Tyrador chose a platinum-iridium alloy to maximize gleam and scratchproofing.=16624
Skin/Info/SCVUmojan,Robust und zuverlässig, das sind zwei Adjektive, die umojanische WBFs am besten beschreiben. Mit ihren eingebauten Laserbohrern zerlegen sie selbst die dicksten Gesteinsbrocken sauber und präzise.=16625
Skin/Info/SensorTower,Mit ihrer Kombination aus elektromagnetischer und thermaler Energie sowie ihren Doppleranalysesystemen und seismischen Sensoren strahlen diese Türme ein Multispektrum aus, das Feinde leicht aufspüren und zuordnen können.=16626
Skin/Info/SensorTowerCovertOps,Nachdem ein falscher Alarm durch eine übergroße Motte dazu führte, dass ein ganzer Handelsposten auf Mar Sara eingeäschert wurde, wurde die Sensorkapazität der nächsten Generation Sensortürme geringfügig zurückgefahren.=16627
Skin/Info/SensorTowerSilver,Kurze Zeit nach dem Angriff der Zerberus-Zerg begannen die Sensortürme von Tyrador, seltsame seismische Muster aufzuzeichnen. Diese wurden jedoch den umfassenden Bauanstrengungen der Ihan-rii zugeordnet. /// Soon after the Cerberus zerg attacked, Tyrador sensor towers began detecting strange seismic patterns, but these were attributed to widespread Ihan-rii construction efforts.=16628
Skin/Info/Sentry,Protektoren sind robotische Kampfdrohnen mit Kraftfeldgeneratoren und Holoprojektoren. Sie wurden entwickelt, um die schwindende Anzahl an Protoss-Kriegern zu unterstützen und zu beschützen.=16629
Skin/Info/SentryGolden,Protektoren haben unter den Protosstechnologien keine eindeutigen Vorgänger. Sie wurden von erfindungsreichen Phasenschmieden neu entwickelt als Ergänzung zu anderen Modellen mit einer längeren Geschichte.=16630
Skin/Info/SentryIhanrii,Vor langer Zeit nutzten die Ihan-rii-Protoss instabile Xel'Naga-Artefakte, um ihre Protektoren mit Energie zu versorgen. Heute verbleiben nur noch wenige dieser Artefakte. /// Long ago, the Ihan-rii protoss harnessed volatile xel'naga artifacts known as "nebula wells" to power their sentries. Few of these artifacts remain.=16631
Skin/Info/SentryPurifier,Obgleich die Richter in ihrer Armee Induktoren bevorzugen, befinden sich auch einige Protektoren in ihren Rängen. Diese ferngesteuerten Drohnen wurden in das Datennetz der Richter eingebunden, um nicht auf psionische Energie angewiesen zu sein.=16632
Skin/Info/SentryTaldarim,Die meisten Protektoren, die den Tal'darim in die Hände fallen, werden zwar zu Aggressoren umfunktioniert, doch einige bleiben großteils unverändert. Dadurch vergrößert sich das Spektrum der robotischen Unterstützung und es bietet gleichzeitig ein gewisses Maß an Irreführung.=16633
Skin/Info/ShieldBattery,Aufgrund von Fortschritten in der Schildregenerationstechnologie im Zuge des Brood War wurden Schildbatterien großteils aufgegeben. Nachdem Verbesserungen an ihrer Leistung und Kapazität vorgenommen wurden, haben einige Fraktionen sie nun wieder in ihr Arsenal aufgenommen.=16634
Skin/Info/ShieldBatteryForged,Zwar verfügen die Tal'darim über Schildbatterien, jedoch stecken sie ihre Ressourcen üblicherweise in offensivere Maßnahmen.=16635
Skin/Info/ShieldBatteryIhanrii,Um die Errichtung eines umfassenden Verteidigungsnetzwerks von Schildbatterien und eines mächtigen stehenden Heers zu rechtfertigen, führen die Ihan-rii den "Schutz gegen gefährliche Wildtiere" an. /// To justify their construction of a vast shield battery defense network and a powerful standing army, the Ihan-rii cite "defense against unruly wildlife."=16636
Skin/Info/SiegeTank,Der Crucio ist das Nachfolgemodell des Arclite und ist sowohl vielseitig einsetzbar als auch mit der nötigen Feuerkraft ausgestattet. Schlachtfeldkommandanten schwören in allen Angriffs- und Verteidigungssitationen auf diesen Belagerungspanzer.=16637
Skin/Info/SiegeTankCovertOps,Auch wenn sich der Crucio schon seit geraumer Zeit großer Beliebtheit bei den Kommandanten der Liga erfreut, bestand bei ihm doch noch Verbesserungsspielraum. Verstärkte Panzerplatten und gewaltigere Kanonen machen diese Version noch beeindruckender.=16638
Skin/Info/SiegeTankJunker,Diese imposanten Panzer wurden so umfassend modifiziert, dass sie ihrem Ursprungsmodell, dem Crucio, kaum noch ähneln. Und zumindest wenn es um spontane Stockcar-Rennen geht, schlagen sie sich wesentlich besser als ihre Vorläufer.=16639
Skin/Info/SiegeTankMerc,Terranische Söldner sind besonders kreativ, wenn es darum geht, Fahrzeuge aufzumotzen – sei es durch Aufbohren des Motors, um die Leistung zu steigern, sei es durch vielfältige Steuerkonfigurationen oder aber durch Änderungen des Erscheinungsbilds, um Gegner einzuschüchtern.=16640
Skin/Info/SiegeTankSilver,Höhere Würdenträger werden bei Besuchen auf Tyrador von auf Hochglanz polierten Belagerungspanzern empfangen, die zehn Begrüßungsalven in die Luft feuern. /// Dignitaries above a certain rank are greeted upon their arrival in Tyrador with a ten-round salute from a company of spotless platinum-alloy siege tanks. =16641
Skin/Info/SiegeTankUmojan,Umojanische Belagerungspanzer vom Typ Imperator sind eine relativ neue Erfindung und haben sich in ersten Kampfeinsätzen ihren terranischen Gegenstücken mehr als ebenbürtig erwiesen. Sehr zur Zufriedenheit ihrer Entwickler.=16642
Skin/Info/SpawningPool,Die großen Becken des Brutschleimpools beherbergen mittlerweile mehr Genstränge als nur den Zergling, wie etwa die flugunfähigen Variationen der Königinnen.=16643
Skin/Info/SpawningPoolMecha,Zusätze aus Polymertitan ermöglichen dem Replika-Brutschleimpool, sich der flüchtigen Substanz des Pools anzupassen und ihr standzuhalten.=16644
Skin/Info/SpawningPoolRCZ,Temperatur und pH-Wert der Zerberus-Brutschleimpools werden durch kybernetische Verbesserungen deutlich präziser reguliert als bei ihren rein biologischen Vorläufern. /// Cybernetic enhancements keep Cerberus spawning pools in temperature and pH ranges considerably more precise than their pure-biological antecedents.=16645
Skin/Info/SpineCrawler,Nach dem Brood War entwickelte der Schwarm Stachelkrabbler, um sich besser gegen Bodenangriffe zu verteidigen. Sie sind in der Lage, auf dem Schlachtfeld ihre Position zu wechseln, um verschiedene Gebiete zu sichern und zu kontrollieren.=16646
Skin/Info/SpineCrawlerMecha,Ein Speerelement mit einer monomolekularen Spitze lässt den Replika-Stachelkrabbler auch die dicksten terranischen Panzerungen durchbohren.=16647
Skin/Info/SpineCrawlerRCZ,Zerberus nutzt tausende ferngesteuerte Stachelkrabbler, um die Netzwerke der Lavatunnel zu erweitern, die sich durch die Kruste von Tyrador IX ziehen. /// Cerberus has tasked thousands of remote-control spine crawlers with expanding the lava tube networks that criss-cross Tyrador IX's crust.=16648
Skin/Info/Spire,Die riesigen Nester der Mantis-Kreischer dienten den Zerg als Basis für den Entwurf ihrer Schösslinge. Ihr Fundament mit den massiven Stängeln besteht aus flexiblen Muskeln. /// The towering nests of the mantis screamers formed the basis for the zerg spire. The stalks that form their foundation are made of flexible muscle.=16649
Skin/Info/SpireMecha,Ein Treibgaslager für Replika-Mutalisken und -Schänder verhindert, dass sich der Schössling an seinen Haltekabeln aufscheuert.=16650
Skin/Info/SpireRCZ,Mutalisken der unterirdischen Zerberus-Schösslinge nutzen zur Jagd ein Echoortungssystem, das sie von den riesigen Fledermäusen übernommen haben, die bis zur Ankunft der Zerg die gefährlichsten Höhlenbewohner des Planeten waren. /// Mutalisks from subterranean Cerberus spires exhibit echolocative hunting behavior absorbed from Tyrador gigabats, previously the planet's scariest cave-dwelling creature.=16651
Skin/Info/SporeCrawler,Sporenkolonien reichten nicht aus, um den Overmind vor seiner Vernichtung zu bewahren. Um ihre Spezies besser beschützen zu können, entwickelten die Zerg ihre Luftabwehr weiter. Das Resultat waren die flexibleren Sporenkrabbler. /// Spore colonies were not enough to prevent the Overmind's elimination. In order to protect their species, zerg evolved their air defense, creating the more flexible spore crawler.=16652
Skin/Info/SporeCrawlerMecha,Der erste terranische Pilot, der herausfand, dass die ungefährliche Munition der Replika-Sporenkrabbler durch eine Nanonachahmung der echten Substanz ersetzt worden war, erhielt zum Dank ein großzügiges Finanzpolster sowie goldbeschlagene Beinprothesen.=16653
Skin/Info/SporeCrawlerRCZ,Zerberus-Sporenkrabbler sammeln sich in Höhlen nahe der Oberfläche von Tyrador IX, wo sie riesige Felder pulsierender, stacheliger Stalagmiten bilden. /// Cerberus spore crawlers amass in caverns near Tyrador IX's surface like great fields of pulsing, spiny stalagmites.=16654
Skin/Info/Stalker,Hetzer sind von den Nerazim konstruierte Kampfläufer, in die die Schattenessenz ihrer gefallenen Krieger übertragen wird. Ihre Fähigkeit, sich zu teleportieren, macht sie schnell und unberechenbar.=16655
Skin/Info/StalkerDeluxe,Khalai-Ingenieuren ist es gelungen, die Hetzer-Technologie der Nerazim weiterzuentwickeln. Die Protoss experimentieren nun damit, die Panzerung des Dragoner-Chassis in Gestelle von Kampfläufern zu integrieren.=16656
Skin/Info/StalkerGolden,Phasenschmiede der Khalai haben versucht, die Hetzer der Nerazim mit dem eleganten Stil der alten Templer zu kombinieren. Leider hat die dabei entstandene Konstruktion mehr Verärgerung als Bewunderung ausgelöst.=16657
Skin/Info/StalkerIhanrii,Die Panzerung dieser Hetzer besteht aus belebtem Stein und ist mit heiligen Runen verziert, die vor den Erzfeinden der Ihan-rii schützen sollen. /// These stalkers are inscribed with sacred runes meant to safeguard their animated stone armor against the heretic enemies of the Ihan-rii. =16658
Skin/Info/StalkerPurifier,Die Richter haben die Programmierung ihrer Hetzer verfeinert, um aus einer komplexen Datenbank mit Schlachtsituationen zu lernen. So können sie auch vollautomatisiert die nötige Kampfleistung erbringen.=16659
Skin/Info/StalkerTaldarim,Nicht alle Tal'darim streben danach, in der Kette aufzusteigen. Einigen wollen einfach nur ihre Kampfkünste schärfen und ihrem Hochlord dienen. Oft entscheiden sie sich dafür, Hetzer zu werden, um ihre Feinde besser jagen und zur Strecke bringen zu können.=16660
Skin/Info/Stargate,Das Heranwarpen von Großkampfschiffen benötigt derart riesige Energiemengen, dass die abgegebene Lichtstrahlung noch aus weiter Ferne klar zuzuordnen ist.=16661
Skin/Info/StargateForged,Die verlängerte Bauweise von Tal'darim-Raumportalen hilft ankommenden Schiffen, direkt aus der Landebucht zu starten und sich somit ohne Verzögerung in die Schlacht zu stürzen.=16662
Skin/Info/StargateIhanrii,Die Ihan-rii behaupten zwar, dass sie ihre uralte Heimatwelt mit den Terranern teilen wollen, aber die Produktion von interstellaren Großkampfschiffen in ihren Raumportalen spricht eher für imperiale Motive. /// Though the Ihan-rii claim to be satisfied with partial inhabitation of their ancestral homeworld, their stargates have begun to produce interstellar capital ships, which would suggest somewhat more imperial motives.=16663
Skin/Info/StargateTaldarim,[ph] StargateTaldarim info=16664
Skin/Info/Starport,Das Feldhandbuch des Space-Marine-Corps der Terranischen Liga macht es sehr deutlich, dass die Luftüberlegenheit entscheidend ist für die Vorherrschaft der Terraner im Koprulu-Sektor und darüber hinaus.=16665
Skin/Info/StarportCovertOps,Nach jeder Mission kehrt der Raumhafen der Spezialkräfte mit Mann und Maus in den Orbit zurück, wo er als voll funktionsfähige Raumstation fungiert.=16666
Skin/Info/StarportSilver,Aufgrund zunehmender Bedrohungen aus dem Weltall haben die Wächter von Tyrador die Produktion ihrer Raumhäfen beschleunigt, doch die Ihan-rii bauen ihre Flotte nicht minder schnell aus. /// Proliferating extraplanetary threats have led the Knights of Tyrador to accelerate their starport production schedules, but the Ihan-rii seem to be amassing air units just as quickly.=16667
Skin/Info/SupplyDepot,Jeder fähige Offizier weiß, wie wichtig es ist, eine funktionierende Versorgungslinie aufzubauen. Ohne Depots gefüllt mit Verpflegung und Munition ist Kriegsführung undenkbar.=16668
Skin/Info/SupplyDepotCovertOps,Auf heißeren Planeten ist das Hochleistungslüftungssystem dieser Versorgungsdepots ein beliebter Anlaufort für Space-Marines, die sich nach Feierabend noch ein kühles Blondes gönnen wollen.=16669
Skin/Info/SupplyDepotSilver,Das Einhornsymbol auf jedem Versorgungsdepot der Wächter von Tyrador wird täglich zweimal von Hand poliert – meist von den neuesten und rangniedrigsten Rekruten. /// The unicorn sigil atop each Knights of Tyrador supply depot is hand-polished twice daily, usually by the freshest and lowest-ranking recruits.=16670
Skin/Info/SupplyDepotXPR,Nach dem tragischen Tod der Unternehmenserbin laufen die Geschäfte bei Angel Shipping jetzt wieder an. Die Lieferungen dieser Firma kommen unter Garantie an der Front an, noch vor dem vorgesehenen Lieferdatum und günstiger als erwartet.=16671
Skin/Info/SwarmHost,Der Schwarm glänzt in Sachen Vermehrung, insbesondere bei den abscheulichen Schwarmwirten. Sie erschaffen in Windeseile eine ganze Flut an Schrecken, so kann schon ein einzelner Schwarmwirt eine gegnerische Armee überwältigen.=16672
Skin/Info/SwarmHostMecha,Viele Ingenieure zeigten während der Arbeiten an den Mechaniken des Schwarmwirts Symptome einer rätselhaften Erkrankung. Da die Sicherheitssysteme aber keine Probleme meldeten, lief die Produktion ungestört weiter, abgesehen von ein paar Todesfällen.=16673
Skin/Info/SwarmHostPrimal,Diese Kreaturen sind ein Ableger der Urwirte, die als Vorläufer der Schwarmwirte gelten. Jetzt sind die beiden Gattungen durch eine überraschende Fügung des Schicksals wieder miteinander verschmolzen.=16674
Skin/Info/SwarmHostRCZ,Der Zerberus-Schwarmwirt besitzt eine interne Mikromanufaktur, die jede Schrecke mit der Möglichkeit zur Fernsteuerung ausrüstet. /// The Cerberus swarm host contains an internal microfactory that equips each locust with remote-control headgear.=16675
Skin/Info/SwarmHostWebby,Die Schwarmwirte der Leviathan-Brut sind spezialisiert auf amphibische Angiffe. Sie zeigen viele genetische Merkmale, mit denen sie sich schnell durch die Ozeane bewegen und ihre Beute überwältigen können.=16676
Skin/Info/TechLab,Sobald die Truppengebäude errichtet sind, werden an sie kleine Tech-Labore angeschlossen, in denen Forschung und Entwicklung betrieben wird. Diese Arbeit ist zum Teil extrem gefährlich, sie wird allerdings für erfolgreiche Kriegsführung als unerlässlich angesehen.=16677
Skin/Info/TechLabCovertOps,Die Tech-Labore der Spezialkräfte verwenden Nanotechnologie, die den mit der Liga verbündeten Protoss entwendet wurde. Mit ihr werden die Energieeffizienz sowieso die Forschungsgeschwindigkeit maximiert.=16678
Skin/Info/TechLabSilver,Die Tech-Labore der Wächter von Tyrador sind mit hochmodernen Klimatisierungssystemen ausgestattet, um trotz der heftigen Temperaturschwankungen des Planeten mit maximaler Effizienz arbeiten zu können. /// Knights of Tyrador tech labs feature state-of-the-art climate control systems to maintain peak efficiency through the planet's intense shifts in temperature.=16679
Skin/Info/Tempest,Tempests sind noch nicht lange Teil der Goldenen Armada, haben sich aber ihren Platz als eins der mächtigsten Kriegsschiffe redlich verdient. Vor ihren Desintegrationsgeschützen muss man sich mehr als nur in Acht nehmen.=16680
Skin/Info/TempestGolden,Nach einigem Experimentieren haben Phasenschmiede spezielle Tempest-Modelle entwickelt, deren aufwändig verzierte Panzerung den zerstörerischen Energien der kinetischen Matrix widersteht.=16681
Skin/Info/TempestIhanrii,Die Steinoberfläche der Ihan-rii-Tempest hilft, den gewaltigen Energiestrahl ihrer kinetischen Matrix effektiver zu bündeln. /// The dampening effect of the Ihan-rii tempest's stone surface enhances its ability to focus the incredible power output of its kinetic matrix.=16682
Skin/Info/TempestPurifier,Diese ferngesteuerten Schiffe stellen eine der bezeichnenden Errungenschaften des Richter-Programms dar. Und ihre auf Cybros gefertigte Panzerung zählt zu den markantesten ihrer Art.=16683
Skin/Info/TempestTaldarim,Gelegentlich kommt es vor, dass die Tal'darim doch von den Daelaam beeindruckt werden. Der Bau der Tempests war ein solcher Moment. Als er sie zum ersten Mal im Einsatz sah, schwor der Hochlord, sie für die Todesflotte zu erobern.=16684
Skin/Info/TemplarArchive,Im Templer-Archiv vervollkommnen die Hohen Templer ihre Psi-Fertigkeiten, indem sie die Erinnerungen und Erfahrungen ihrer Vorgänger studieren.=16685
Skin/Info/TemplarArchiveForged,Zwischen den Schlachten dürfen Tal'darim-Krieger aus den oberen Rängen der Kette des Aufstiegs das Templer-Archiv betreten, um dort ihre heroischsten Taten wiederaufleben zu lassen.=16686
Skin/Info/TemplarArchiveIhanrii,Die Templer-Archive der Ihan-rii enthalten die wertvollsten Geheimnisse dieser Zivilisation – unter anderem religiöse Texte und die Anleitung für den schaurigen Prozess zur semi-organischen Erschaffung von belebtem Stein. /// Ihan-rii templar archives contain the civilization's most closely guarded secrets, including religious texts and instructions for the gruesome semi-organic generation of animated stone.=16687
Skin/Info/Thor,Der Thor ist das ultimative Symbol für die Schlagkraft des terranischen Militärs. Die Artillerie, über die er verfügt, reicht aus, um eine ganze Armee gegnerischer Einheiten im Alleingang auszuschalten.=16688
Skin/Info/ThorCE,Liga-Ingenieure liefern sich seit geraumer Zeit einen internen Wettstreit darum, den Thor noch effektiver zu machen. Von den höchsten Stellen werden solche inoffiziellen Aktivitäten wohlwollend geduldet, solange das Ergebnis leistungsfähigere Kampfläufer sind.=16689
Skin/Info/ThorCovertOps,Als markanter Meilenstein zeitgenössischer Waffenbaukunst trumpft der Thor der Liga-Spezialkräfte mit zahllosen Verbesserungen und den neuesten Fortschritten in Sachen Neostahlpanzerung auf.=16690
Skin/Info/ThorJunker,Miras Crew wünscht sich schon seit Langem ihren eigenen Thor, doch mussten sie beim Bau immer wieder Rückschläge hinnehmen. Es kann aber nicht mehr lange dauern, bis sie endlich einen komplett funktionstüchtig machen.=16691
Skin/Info/ThorSilver,Tyradors Thor-Modelle sind mit einer Plutoniumbeschichtung überzogen, die Projektile unterhalb eines gewissen Energiegrenzwerts abhält. Sie machen sich auch sehr hübsch bei Paraden. /// Tyrador thors are treated with a plutonium coating that deflects projectiles below a certain energy threshold. They also look great in parades.=16692
Skin/Info/ThorUmojan,Lange Jahre haben umojanische Konstrukteure fieberhaft nach einer Antwort auf den Thor der Liga gesucht. Das Ergebnis ihrer unermüdlichen Arbeit kann sich sehen lassen. =16693
Skin/Info/TwilightCouncil,Der Zirkel des Zwielichts dient Repräsentanten der Daelaam als Forum für Diskussionen zum Wohle aller Protoss.=16694
Skin/Info/TwilightCouncilForged,Beim Zirkel des Zwielichts der Tal'darim handelt es sich um ein weiteres Gebäude, das den Khalai entwendet wurde. Seine Architektur ist düsterer und bedrohlicher, die gebotenen Upgrademöglichkeiten sind jedoch identisch.=16695
Skin/Info/TwilightCouncilIhanrii,Die Rückkehr auf ihre Heimatwelt Arakyr war für die Ältesten des Zirkels der Ihan-rii sowohl vertraut als auch beunruhigend. Viel hatte sich während ihrer langen Abwesenheit verändert, und ein Großteil davon wie etwa die schlechtere Luftqualität und das Aussterben einiger geliebter Tierarten war auf die Anwesenheit der Terraner zurückzuführen. /// Ihan-rii council elders have found the return to their homeworld, Arakyr, both familiar and unsettling. Much has changed in their long absence, including a decline in air quality and the extinction of several beloved species, both attributable to terran development.=16696
Skin/Info/Ultralisk,Ultralisken sind legendär für ihre Größe und Stärke. Ihre robusten Panzer sind beinah undurchdringlich und mit ihren riesigen Scheren können sie einen Gegner mühelos zerquetschen.=16697
Skin/Info/UltraliskCE,Ultralisken sind ohnehin schon mächtig und zerstörerisch genug, doch wenn sie mit den Urzerg-Essenzen von Zerus erfüllt werden, werden sie zu unaufhaltbaren Tötungmaschinen.=16698
Skin/Info/UltraliskCavern,Diese Höhle ist gefüllt mit gefährlichen Bioablagerungen und starken Strahlungsquellen. Die dabei entstehenden chemischen Reaktionen werden benötigt, um den genetischen Code für die Erschaffung von Ultralisken bereitzustellen.=16699
Skin/Info/UltraliskCavernMecha,Im Inneren der Ultraliskenhöhle des Replika-Projekts wird ihr radioaktiver Kern durch den umgewandelten Hitzeschirm eines Schweren Kreuzers eingedämmt.=16700
Skin/Info/UltraliskCavernRCZ,Diese Ultraliskenhöhle erschafft stündlich drei der gigantischen Kreaturen mit messerscharfen Titanklingen. Dieser furchteinflößende Anblick wird nur dadurch geschmälert, dass die Lichter über dem Maul wie dümmliche kleine Augen wirken, wie ein Vizepräsident von Zerberus einmal trocken bemerkte. /// This ultralisk cavern churns out three sets of gleaming forged-titanium blades every hour, an intimidating purpose only slightly undermined by the fact that--as a Cerberus vice president once wryly observed--the lights above its mouth look like goofy little eyes.=16701
Skin/Info/UltraliskMecha,In der Frühphase des Projekts waren alle Wissenschaftler sich einig, dass die Konstruktion eines künstlichen Ultralisken nicht in Frage kommt. Als das Labor später im Chaos versank, wurde klar, dass jemand diese Abmachung gebrochen haben musste ...=16702
Skin/Info/UltraliskPrimal,Urultralisken weisen ein hohes Maß an äußerlicher Varianz auf, wobei einige stark an die Ultralisken des Schwarms erinnern und andere verschiedene Eigenschaften ausbilden, mit denen sie besser an das Leben auf Zerus angepasst sind.=16703
Skin/Info/UltraliskRCZ,Der fernsteuerbare Ultralisk ist das Vorzeigemodell der Vertriebsabteilung von Zerberus und bildet den Höhepunkt jeder Kundenpräsentation. Die hitzebehandelten Titanklingen sind ein beeindruckender Anblick. /// Cerberus sales teams always make sure to show prospective clients the remote-control ultralisk. Their heat-treated titanium blade implants are a beautiful sight to behold.=16704
Skin/Info/UltraliskRemastered,Die ersten Ultralisken waren schmaler und wendiger, als wir sie heute kennen. Anstelle der massiven Rüstung moderner Ultralisken hatten sie gestählte Muskeln und strapazierfähige Sehnen.=16705
Skin/Info/UltraliskWebby,Nur wenige Lebewesen reichen heran an die schiere Macht des Ultralisken. In der Leviathan-Brut sind ihre schrecklichen Fratzen mit Stacheln und Klingen versehen - die Art Monster von der sonst nur Legenden berichten.=16706
Skin/Info/Viking,Vikings wurden ursprünglich entwickelt, um das Luftabwehrarsenal der Terranischen Liga zu erweitern und gehören dank ihrer beiden vielseitig einsetzbaren Kampfmodi zu Klassikern der modernen Kriegsführung.=16707
Skin/Info/VikingCovertOps,Die ligaeigenen Forscher haben das existierende Design des Viking um einen neuen Satz Zwillingsmotoren ergänzt und gleichzeitig die Feuerkraft in beiden Modi erhöht.=16708
Skin/Info/VikingJunker,Miras Mechaniker haben in Vikings eine Reihe Besonderheiten eingebaut, einschließlich massiver Zwillingsmotoren, die ein beeindruckendes, einschüchterndes Röhren von sich geben, wenn sie voll aufgedreht werden.=16709
Skin/Info/VikingMecha,Auf Betreiben von Imperator Valerian haben Castillo Industries bahnbrechende Innovationen für Viking-Modelle entwickelt. Dieser Prototyp basiert auf einer optimierten und effizienteren Konstruktion.=16710
Skin/Info/VikingSilver,Nachts sind die hellblauen Schubdüsen dieser Viking-Modelle meilenweit sichtbar. Touristen bekommen so das beruhigende Gefühl, dass die Wächter von Tyrador gut über sie wachen. /// At night, the stunning blue thrusters on this viking can be spotted from miles away, reassuring tourists that the Knights of Tyrador are watching over them.=16711
Skin/Info/VikingUmojan,Nach langwierigen Verhandlungen hat Castillo Industries sich bereit erklärt, ein neues schwer gepanzertes Viking-Modell ausschließlich für das Protektorat von Umoja herzustellen.=16712
Skin/Info/Viper,Kein Geringerer als Abathur war es, der die Sequenzen der Vipern von den Urzerg extrahierte und in den Schwarm einarbeitete. Jetzt manipulieren sie das Schlachtfeld zu Gunsten ihres Meisters.=16713
Skin/Info/ViperMecha,Als Projekt Replika kurz vor der Vollendung stand, begannen die leitenden Wissenschaftler sich zu fragen, was sie da eigentlich erschaffen hatten – und zu welchem Preis. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt hörten die Auftraggeber auf, Fragen zu beantworten.=16714
Skin/Info/ViperPrimal,Die ursprünglichen Vipern besitzen eine Reihe besonders bösartiger Verteidigungsmechanismen. So ist es kein Wunder, dass sie von Abathur schnell als erstklassige Testobjekte zur weiteren Evolution verwendet wurden. =16715
Skin/Info/ViperRCZ,Vipern mit kranialen Hammerkopfimplantaten zeigen eine erhebliche Verbesserung der taktilen Effizienz ihrer Greifarme. /// Vipers with hammerhead cranial implants demonstrate dramatic increases in prehensile proboscis precision.=16716
Skin/Info/ViperWebby,Als Teil einer der ursprünglichen Zerg-Bruten weisen die Vipern der Leviathan-Brut mehr Tendenzen zu Vergiftern auf als beim Rest des Schwarms. Auch wenn dies zu vielen Missbildungen führt, scheinen es die starken Toxine doch wert zu sein.=16717
Skin/Info/VoidRay,Die Phasengleiter sind das Ergebnis einer Kombination aus Technologie der Templer und der Nerazim. Diese vernichtenden Kampfschiffe demonstrieren eindrucksvoll, was möglich ist, wenn zwei Fraktionen ein gemeinsames Ziel verfolgen.=16718
Skin/Info/VoidRayGolden,Bei den neuesten Phasengleitern wurde die klassische Eleganz alter Templerkonstruktionen mit der düsteren Ästhetik der Nerazim kombiniert.=16719
Skin/Info/VoidRayIhanrii,Gerade als die Verteidigung von Neu-Canaan überrannt wurde, erschien auf Tyrador IX eine Flotte von Steinschiffen. Mit Strahlen gebündelter Leerenenergie dezimierte sie die Schwärme der Zerberus-Zerg und drängte sie in die Defensive. /// On Tyrador IX, a fleet of stone ships with shrieking void-energy beams appeared and blindsided the Cerberus zerg just as they overran New Canaan's defenses. =16720
Skin/Info/VoidRayPurifier,Die Phasengleiter der Richter sind ein wahres Meisterwerk der Ingenieurskunst. Sie vereinen die Forschung dreier unterschiedlicher Protoss-Fraktionen in einem einzigen eleganten Schiff.=16721
Skin/Info/VoidRayTaldarim,An Blutsplitterkristalle kommt man nicht so leicht heran. Wenn die Tal'darim nicht genügend zur Verfügung haben, um einen Phasengleiter in einen Zerstörer zu verwandeln, nutzen sie ohne zu zögern die bestehende Bewaffnung des Schiffes.=16722
Skin/Info/WarpPrism,Warpprismen kumulieren die Psi-Matrix und fungieren somit gleichermaßen als mobiler Truppentransporter und als behelfsmäßige Energiequelle. Sie mögen empfindlich sein, doch sind sie ein elementarer Bestandteil jeder Protoss-Flotte.=16723
Skin/Info/WarpPrismGolden,Klassische Warpprismen der Templer enthielten ein unverwechselbares Kristallgitter, das oftmals die neuronalen Muster der Krieger reflektierte, die sie beförderten.=16724
Skin/Info/WarpPrismIhanrii,Geöffnet erinnern Warpprismen der Ihan-rii an eine Blume, die einst die Hänge ihrer Heimatwelt bedeckte. Die derzeitigen Bewohner dieser Welt nennen diesen Planeten "Tyrador IX".  /// Unfurled, the Ihan-rii warp prism evokes a flower that once covered the hillsides of their homeworld, referred to by its current residents as "Tyrador IX."  =16725
Skin/Info/WarpPrismNerazim,Phasenschmiede der Daelaam haben einen technologischen Durchbruch erzielt: Durch eine Reihe von Modifikationen sind Warpprismen nun in der Lage, Leerenenergie zu nutzen. Diese als Phasenprismen bekannten Neuentwicklungen erfreuen sich unter Nerazim-Kommandanten großer Beliebtheit.=16726
Skin/Info/WarpPrismPurifier,Die Warpprismen der Richter können im Notfall automatisch eine K.I.-Persönlichkeit in eine andere Hülle transferieren, und das überall auf dem Schlachtfeld.=16727
Skin/Info/WarpPrismTaldarim,Ob man Warpprismen mit fortgeschrittener Bewaffnung ausstatten sollte, daran scheiden sich die Geister der Flottengebieter. Einige ziehen es vor, mit ihnen ausschließlich ihre Krieger auf das Schlachtfeld zu befördern.=16728
Skin/Info/WidowMine,Die Arachnomine wurde ursprünglich von Victor Kachinsky entworfen und später zu einem überraschend tödlichen Gerät weiterentwickelt, das unachtsame Feinde mit Abwehrraketen in die Luft jagt.=16729
Skin/Info/WidowMineCovertOps,Basierend auf unerklärlichen Fehlzündungen haben die Techniker die Arachnomine mit einer Schutzpanzerung ausgestattet, um Unfälle einzudämmen und sie vor ungewollten Beschädigungen zu schützen.=16730
Skin/Info/WidowMineJunker,Nach einer Reihe äußerst zerstörerischer Experimente haben Miras Söldner ihre Arachnominen so umgebaut, dass sie zusätzliche Bewaffnung und Sprengstoffe unterbringen können.=16731
Skin/Info/WidowMineSilver,Selbst nach zahlreichen blutigen Unfällen, die immer wieder Schlagzeilen machen, bleiben die schmucken Arachnominen ein beliebtes Haustier der Schönen und Reichen auf Tyrador IX. /// Despite gory accidents that make the news from time to time, sleek and shiny widow mines remain a common pet in the upper-class households of Tyrador IX.=16732
Skin/Info/WidowMineUmojan,Robotik ist eine zentrale Technologie im Protektorat von Umoja. Daher ist es nicht verwunderlich, dass für die Entwicklung einer neuen Generation von Arachnominen ein exklusiver Wettbewerb abgehalten wurde. Bemerkenswert ist allerdings, dass der Gewinner eine junge Studentin war, die noch an ihrer Abschlussarbeit schrieb.=16733
Skin/Info/Zealot,Berserker sind Krieger, die auf dem Schlachtfeld ihres Gleichen suchen. Sie durchlaufen eine Jahrzehnte währende intensive Kampfausbildung bis sie ihre Fähigkeiten perfektioniert haben. Ihre charakteristischen Psi-Klingen werden von ihrer eigenen psionischen Energie versorgt.=16734
Skin/Info/ZealotGolden,Viele Berserker entwickelten wie die Hohen Templer eine starke Verehrung für das Goldene Zeitalter der Protoss und die künstlerischen und kulturellen Errungenschaften dieser Blütezeit. Von offizieller Seite wird diese Bewegung bisher jedoch noch nicht anerkannt.=16735
Skin/Info/ZealotIhanrii,Die Berserker der Ihan-rii-Protoss glauben, dass eines Tages die Xel'Naga zurückkehren werden, um alle tapferen Krieger zu unsterblichen Göttern zu machen. /// Zealots of the Ihan-rii protoss believe the xel'naga will return one day to bless valiant warriors with eternal godhood.=16736
Skin/Info/ZealotPurifier,Auch wenn sie keine einzigartige Persönlichkeit besitzen, so sind die Vollstrecker doch als edle Krieger programmiert und stehen den gefeierten Berserkern in nichts nach.=16737
Skin/Info/ZealotRemastered,Viele Berserker kämpften während des Großen Krieges ohne Kopfpanzerung, um ihren Mut zu beweisen. Diese Praktik wird mittlerweile nicht mehr angewendet. /// To demonstrate their fearlessness, many zealots went without head armor during the Great War. This practice has since been discontinued.=16738
Skin/Info/ZealotTaldarim,Die untersten Glieder der Kette des Aufstiegs sind, wie sollte es anders sein, auch am begierigsten darauf, sich zu beweisen. Ein Berserker der Tal'darim ist ein nicht zu unterschätzender Gegner.=16739
Skin/Info/ZealotXPR,Obwohl es die Konklave nicht mehr gibt, verspüren die Prätoren, denen einst die militärische Führung zufiel, immer noch ein tiefes Pflichtgefühl – heute gegenüber den Daelaam. Solange die Protoss bestehen, werden sie mit höchstem Heldenmut weiterkämpfen.=16740
Skin/Info/Zergling,Zerglinge sind wild und unberechenbar und daher am gefährlichsten, wenn sie in großen Gruppen angreifen, die von einer weiter entwickelten Zerg-Gattung kontrolliert werden.=16741
Skin/Info/ZerglingMecha,Obwohl sie vom Aussehen und Verhalten genau wie Zerglinge sind, handelt es sich bei diesen Replikas um rein mechanische Reproduktionen, die allein von elektrischer Energie angetrieben werden, anstatt die DNS ihrer Feinde zu absorbieren.=16742
Skin/Info/ZerglingPrimal,Einige der kleineren Urzerglinge erinnern stark an ihre Gegenstücke aus dem Schwarm. Das geht sogar so weit, dass sie ähnliches Angriffspotential entwickelt haben.=16743
Skin/Info/ZerglingRCZ,Das Nervensystem von Zerglingen ist so hyperaktiv, dass Zerberus-Ingenieure zwei Antennen anbringen mussten, um ihre Bewegung effektiv kontrollieren zu können. /// Zergling nervous systems are so hyperactive that Cerberus engineers had to affix two antennas to control their movement properly.=16744
Skin/Info/ZerglingWebby,Die Reduktion des Zergling-Genoms hatte unvorhersehbare Folgen. Die zusätzlichen Auswüchse der Zerglinge der Leviathan-Brut wurden nicht gezielt entwickelt, sondern sie sind das Nebenprodukt extrem vereinfachter DNS.=16745
Skin/Info/ZerglingXPR,Nur wenige Zerg haben eine geringere Lebenserwartung als ein Zergling. Jegliche Mutation, die diese Lebenserwartung erhöhen könnte, ist es wert, genauer in Augenschein genommen zu werden.=16746
