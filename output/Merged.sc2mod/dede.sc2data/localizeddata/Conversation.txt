Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00006,In dieser Übung sollen Sie mit den wenigen Einheiten, die Ihnen zur Verfügung stehen, einen möglichst hohen Schaden unter den gegnerischen Truppen anrichten.=432
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00007,Die Spezialfähigkeiten Ihrer Einheiten sind der Schlüssel zum Erreichen eines hohen Punktestandes, also setzen Sie sie mit Bedacht ein.=433
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00008,Gegnerische Einheiten sind so lange unverwundbar, bis Sie Ihre Bereitschaft durch Drücken der "Bereit"-Taste bestätigen.=434
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00009,Du musst so viele Feinde wie möglich mit den dir zur Verfügung stehenden Kreaturen vernichten.=435
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00010,Erkunde die feindliche Basis. Wenn du bereit bist, deinen Angriff zu beginnen, betätige die "Bereit"-Taste.=436
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00011,Du hast nicht viel Zeit! Greife ohne Gnade an und füge größtmöglichen Schaden zu!=437
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00012,En Taro Tassadar, Adept. Ein Protoss-Krieger muss lernen, Feinde zu bekämpfen, die so zahlreich sind wie die Sterne am Nachthimmel.=438

Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00015,En Taro Tassadar, Adept. Ein Protoss-Krieger muss die Stärken der eigenen Streitkräfte ebenso wie die Schwächen des Gegners kennen.=441
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00016,In dieser Simulation werdet Ihr eine begrenzte Streitmacht zur Verteidigung dreier Pylonen befehligen.=442
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00017,Die Pylonen liegen weit auseinander, also werdet Ihr Eure Streitkräfte aufteilen müssen, um alle drei zu verteidigen.=443
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00018,Studiert die gegnerischen Kräfte und setzt Eure Einheiten so ein, dass sie dem Gegner möglichst effektiv entgegenwirken.=444
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00019,Sobald Ihr Eure Einheiten verteilt habt, betätigt die "Bereit"-Taste, um zu beginnen.=445
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00020,Seid achtsam, jeder Versuch, den Aufstellungsbereich zu verlassen, wird bestraft.=446
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00021,Diese drei Schösslinge werden bedroht. Du musst sie mit den dir zur Verfügung stehenden Einheiten verteidigen.=447
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00022,Die Schösslinge sind weit voneinander entfernt, also musst du deine Einheiten aufteilen, um sie alle zu verteidigen.=448
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00023,Wäge die Stärken und Schwächen deiner Gegner sorgfältig ab. Stelle dann deine Diener so auf, dass sie die jeweiligen Angreifer am effektivsten bekämpfen können.=449
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00024,Wenn du deine Vorbereitungen abgeschlossen hast, betätige die "Bereit"-Taste um zu beginnen.=450
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00025,Sei gewarnt! Ein Verlassen des Aufstellungsbereichs wird nicht toleriert!=451

Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00038,Willkommen zurück, Commander. Eine starke Wirtschaft ist der Schlüssel zum Erfolg, und der Schlüssel zu einer starken Wirtschaft ist effizientes Ressourcenmanagement.=464
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00039,In dieser Übung werden Ihre Fähigkeiten zum Führen einer Basis getestet. Beginnen Sie, indem Sie ausreichend Ressourcen abbauen, um am nahen Ressourcenvorkommen expandieren zu können.=465
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00040,Durch den Bau einer zweiten Kommandozentrale am Expansionspunkt können Sie Ihren Ressourcenertrag effektiv verdoppeln.=466
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00041,Schließen Sie die Übung ab, indem Sie eine Streitkraft ausbilden, bevor die Zeit abgelaufen ist.=467
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00042,Guten morgen, Commander. Ihr Ziel in dieser Übung ist es, mehrere Angriffswellen des Feindes zu überleben.=468
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00043,Jede Welle wird schwer niederzuringen sein mit den zur Verfügung stehenden Kräften. Die direkte Kontrolle über die Aktionen Ihrer Einheiten wird Ihnen den Vorteil sichern, den Sie zum Bestehen brauchen.=469
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00044,Betätigen Sie die "Bereit"-Taste, wenn Sie beginnen möchten.=470
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00045,Willkommen, Commander. Ihr Ziel in dieser Übung ist es, ausschließlich mit den zugeteilten Belagerungspanzern und Medivacs maximalen Schaden anzurichten.=471
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00046,Sie werden nur begrenzte Zeit zur Verfügung haben, um die gegnerische Basis so weit wie möglich zu zerstören. Es wird empfohlen, die Basis vor dem Angriff mit Ihren Medivacs zu erkunden.=472
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00047,Feindliche Einheiten können nicht verletzt werden, bis Sie die "Bereit"-Taste drücken, also erkunden Sie mit Sorgfalt.=473
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00048,Sobald Ihr bereit seid, schlagt schnell zu! Vernichtet so viele Feinde wie möglich, bevor die Zeit abgelaufen ist!=474

Conversation/Tutorial/Line00032,Viele Zerg können sich auf dem Schlachtfeld von einer Form in eine andere morphen. Auch Zerg-Strukturen können von einer Form zu einer anderen mutieren. Dabei werden sie mächtiger und ermöglichen den Bau neuer Einheiten. /// Many Zerg creatures can morph from one form to another on the battlefield. Zerg structures can also mutate from one form to another, growing more powerful and unlocking new unit types as they do.=1035
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00033,Die Drohne wird beim Erstellen der Struktur verbraucht, deshalb brauchen Sie zum Bau einer weiteren Struktur eine weitere Drohne. /// The Drone is consumed when the structure is created, so you will need another Drone to build another structure.=1036
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00034,Kriecher ist eine Biomasse, die sich um alle Zerg-Basen ausbreitet. Die meisten Zerg-Einheiten bewegen sich auf Kriecher schneller, und alle Zerg-Gebäude bis auf die Brutstätte müssen darauf gebaut werden. Gebäude, die sich nicht auf Kriecher befinden, werden langsam verenden. /// Creep is an organic growth that spreads around any Zerg base. Most Zerg units will move more quickly when they're on creep, and all Zerg structures except Hatcheries must be built on it. Structures that are no longer on creep will slowly die.=1037
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00035,Kriecher wird von Brutstätten, Königinnen und Overlords erzeugt. Benutzen Sie diese Einheiten und Gebäude, um Ihren Kriecher auszudehnen. /// Creep is generated by Hatcheries, Queens, and Overlords, so you can use these units and structures to expand your creep.   =1038
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00036,Für die Mutation zu einer Zerg-Struktur muss erst eine Drohne ausgewählt werden.

Falls Sie nicht über genügend Versorgung verfügen, können Sie die Einheit nicht heranwarpen. /// Before you can warp in a unit, you must have the supplies to support that unit. If you do not have enough available supply, you will not be able to warp in that unit.=1046
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00044,Die Protoss sind eine uralte, außerirdische Spezies, die fortschrittliche Technologien und mächtige Psi-Kräfte einsetzt, um ihre Gegner zu besiegen. /// The Protoss are an ancient alien race that employ advanced technologies and powerful psionics to defeat their enemies.=1047
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00045,Die Einheiten und Gebäude der Protoss werden durch Schilde vor Angriffen geschützt. Schilde werden in der Trefferpunktanzeige blau dargestellt. /// Protoss have shields on their units and structures to protect them from enemy attacks. Shield strength is represented by a blue bar above the hit-point bar.=1048
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00046,Schilde werden bei feindlichen Angriffen genauso wie Trefferpunkte reduziert, jedoch regenerieren sich Schilde schnell nach Ende des Kampfes. /// Shields are reduced by enemy attacks in the same manner as hit-points, however shields regenerate quickly after combat has finished. =1049
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00047,Xel'Naga-Wachtürme können von jedem Spieler kontrolliert werden.

Place a unit near the Watch Tower to activate it and reveal a large area of the battlefield.=1050
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00048,Wenn sich Einheiten mehrerer Spieler in der Nähe eines Turmes befinden, wird dieser nicht kontrolliert und kein Spieler kann ihn aktivieren. /// If several players have units near a Watch Tower then the tower is not controlled and no player can activate it.=1051
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00049,Einige Hindernisse können durch Waffeneinsatz zerstört werden. Sie können sie angreifen, um den Pfad für Ihre Truppen zu räumen. /// Some obstacles can be destroyed by weapons fire, and you can attack obstacles to clear a path for your troops.  =1052
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00050,Einige Elemente wie Gebüsch oder Rauch blockieren die Sicht. Ihre Einheiten können sich frei hindurch bewegen, jedoch können nur fliegende Einheiten dahinter liegende Bereiche einsehen. /// Some features like shrubs and smoke will block your vision. Your units can move through these features freely but only flying units can see past them.=1053
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00051,Sie können Ihre Einheiten in Steuerungsgruppen einteilen. Das erleichtert es, schnell auf eine Gruppe Einheiten zuzugreifen. /// You can put your units into control groups. This makes it easy to quickly select a group of units.=1054
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00052,Um eine Steuerungsgruppe zu erstellen, wählen Sie Ihre Einheiten aus und linksklicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche der Steuerungsgruppe. Sie finden sie über dem Informationsfenster unten in der Mitte Ihres Bildschirms. /// To create a control group, select your units and left-click the Control Group button.
