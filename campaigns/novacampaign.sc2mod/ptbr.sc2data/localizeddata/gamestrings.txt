Map/LoadingHelp/Nova02=As forças inimigas devem ter unidades voadoras para enxergar suas unidades em terrenos elevados. Use isso para armar emboscadas e evitar retaliações.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova03=Defenda sua base com Casamatas e Tanques de Cerco. Se eles forem danificados, use os VCEs para consertá-los.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova04=Vudus são excelentes para causar dano, mas também são unidades bem frágeis. Use a habilidade Camuflar e evite detectores para mantê-las vivas.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova05=Uma estratégia defensiva eficiente é posicionar Libertadores em Modo de Defesa em passagens estreitas estratégicas.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova06=Experimente diferentes tecnologias de unidades e equipamentos para reagir aos tipos de inimigos que você espera combater.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova07=Durante missões de infiltração furtiva, pode ser útil usar a habilidade Cessar Fogo<k val="Ghost,GhostHoldFire,1,2"/> de Nova para impedir que ela faça alvos inimigos automaticamente.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova08=A batalha se passa na cidade inteira. Use o sistema de metrô para transportar rapidamente o seu exército de um ponto a outro.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova09=O Xanto pode consertar a si mesmo após receber muito dano, mas fica vulnerável enquanto isso. Atinja-o antes que ele termine seu conserto.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova01=As habilidades de Nova são fundamentais para se obter sucesso. Use Tiro de Precisão para eliminar fantasmas inimigos e Granadas de Pulso para aniquilar grandes grupos de forças inimigas.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova02=Construa Quartéis ou acople Reatores extras para produzir várias unidades de exército de uma vez.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova03=Se você ordenar que suas unidades ataquem um ponto do terreno, elas atacarão todos os inimigos que encontrarem pelo caminho. Isso se chama movimento de ataque.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova04=Os zergs retaliarão quando a base de Nova for estabelecida. Destrua o máximo de incubadoras que puder para enfraquecer futuros ataques.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova05=Os Infestados são atraídos para os Dispositivos de Extração. Monte suas defesas antes de iniciar o processo.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova06=A seleção de unidades durante flashbacks determina os tipos de inimigos que você encontrará. Escolha com cuidado.

Map/Summary/Nova01=Nova fugiu de uma misteriosa instalação onde ela e vários fantasmas estavam sendo mantidos presos. Perguntas sem resposta permeiam sua mente enquanto ela tenta restabelecer contato com a Supremacia, na esperança de que eles possam lançar alguma luz sobre com quem ela estava e por que estava lá.
Map/Summary/Nova02=Nova descobriu que é procurada por traição depois de ser vista atuando com o grupo terrorista conhecido como os Defensores do Homem... o mesmo grupo responsável por rechaçar uma súbita investida zerg contra o mundo de Bórea, pertencente à Supremacia. Agora, novamente sob as ordens da Supremacia, cabe a ela desvelar os planos dos Defensores.
Map/Summary/Nova03=Ao restaurar uma parte de suas memórias apagadas, Nova localizou e se infiltrou na base dos Defensores do Homem em Tarsonis. Ela descobriu que eles estão controlando sua própria casta zerg e usando-a para realizar ataques contra mundos da Supremacia por todo o setor. Agora, sua equipe está prestes a se defrontar com um ataque zerg iminente contra um planeta civil densamente povoado.
Map/Summary/Nova04=Embora tenha chegado tarde para impedir a infestação de Tyrador IX, Nova resgatou os sobreviventes civis tanto dos zergs quanto dos Tal'darim. Mas seus esforços também fortaleceram os Defensores do Homem, que levaram o crédito pela evacuação.
Map/Summary/Nova05=Depois de vencer o desafio de Alarak, Nova agora possui o terrazino de que precisa para se lembrar de sua história com os Defensores do Homem. Apesar dos riscos envolvidos, ela está confiante de que usar o terrazino revelará a identidade do líder deles.
Map/Summary/Nova06=Nova descobriu a perturbadora verdade acerca de seu tempo com os Defensores do Homem e agora tem as provas necessárias para levá-los à justiça. Mas Valerian ordenou a ela que esperasse e confiasse em seu plano... que envolve a renúncia dele como imperador da Supremacia.
Map/Summary/Nova07=Nova se infiltrou com êxito no complexo de Davis e a capturou. Quando Valerian revelar as evidências dos crimes de Davis e sua liderança dos Defensores do Homem, no final do discurso dele, a Supremacia poderá enfim retomar a paz.
Map/Summary/Nova08=Junto com a Supremacia e os desertores dos Defensores do Homem, Nova rechaçou o ataque da Frota da Morte em Vardona. Mas Davis tirou proveito do caos da batalha para escapar da custódia. Agora Nova precisa rastreá-la e levá-la à justiça, de uma vez por todas.
Map/Summary/Nova09=Os Defensores do Homem foram derrotados e Davis está morta. Por desobedecer uma ordem direta ao matar Davis, Nova agora precisa fugir. Apesar de seu status como fugitiva, ela continua pronta para liderar sua equipe na luta pela Supremacia, mas em seus próprios termos.</n></n>Graças aos esforços de uma agente secreta, uma conspiração que tomou inúmeras vidas inocentes foi exposta e desmantelada, e a ordem foi restaurada. Isso conclui a história de Nova: Operações Secretas. Agradecemos a todos pelo que fizeram.
