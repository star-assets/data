Map/LoadingHelp/Nova01=Nova es una poderosa heroína con habilidades especiales. Puedes seleccionarla pulsando <c val="ffff00"><k val="HeroSelect0"/></c> o haciendo clic en su icono en la esquina superior izquierda de la pantalla.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova02=Las fuerzas enemigas necesitan unidades voladoras para ver a tus unidades en terreno elevado. Aprovecha este factor para planear emboscadas y evitar represalias.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova03=Defiende tu base con búnkeres y tanques de asedio. Si sufren daños, usa VCE para repararlos.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova04=Las átropos son buenas infligiendo daño, pero tienen poca resistencia. Usa su invisibilidad y evita los detectores para mantenerlas con vida.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova05=Coloca liberadores en modo defensor sobre cuellos de botella estratégicos para obtener una buena defensa.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova06=Prueba diferentes opciones tecnológicas para tus unidades y tu equipo en respuesta a los distintos tipos de enemigos a los que debas enfrentarte.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova07=Durante las misiones de infiltración en sigilo, puede resultar útil usar la habilidad no disparar<k val="Ghost,GhostHoldFire,1,2"/> de Nova para evitar que dispare a los enemigos de forma automática.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova08=La batalla se extiende por toda la ciudad. Usa el sistema de trenes subterráneos para llevar a tu ejército rápidamente de un punto a otro.

Map/LoadingHelp/Nova09=El Xanthos puede repararse a sí mismo tras sufrir mucho daño, pero es vulnerable mientras lo hace. Derríbalo antes de que termine de repararse.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova01=Usar bien las habilidades de Nova es vital. Utiliza disparo de precisión para eliminar a fantasmas enemigos y granadas de pulsos para aniquilar a grupos grandes de fuerzas enemigas.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova02=Construye más barracones o reactores anexos para entrenar a varias unidades a la vez.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova03=Si ordenas a tus unidades que ataquen un punto específico del terreno, atacarán a los enemigos que encuentren por el camino. Esta estrategia se llama atacar-mover.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova04=Los zerg contraatacarán cuando la base de Nova esté establecida. Destruye tantos criaderos como puedas para debilitar los ataques futuros.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova05=Los dispositivos de extracción atraen a los infestados. Prepara tus defensas antes de iniciar el proceso.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova06=Las unidades que selecciones durante los recuerdos determinarán con qué tipos de enemigos te encontrarás. Elige bien.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova07=Si un encuentro resulta demasiado difícil, prueba otra táctica con equipo diferente.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova08=Las gorgonas pueden disparar en todas direcciones a medida que avanzan por la ciudad. Sincroniza bien su uso para poder acabar con el máximo de enemigos posible.

Map/Summary/Nova01=Nova ha escapado de una instalación misteriosa en la que la tenían retenida junto a otros fantasmas. Con la cabeza llena de preguntas, intenta restablecer el contacto con el Dominio, con la esperanza de que le puedan aclarar con quién estaba y por qué estaba allí.
Map/Summary/Nova02=Nova ha descubierto que está en busca y captura por traición, ya que ha sido vista trabajando con un grupo terrorista conocido como los Defensores del Hombre... El mismo grupo que frustró un repentino ataque zerg en Borea, uno de los mundos del Dominio. Ahora, otra vez como agente del Dominio, Nova debe desvelar los planes de los Defensores.
Map/Summary/Nova03=Al recuperar una parte de sus recuerdos perdidos, Nova ha podido localizar e infiltrarse en una base de los Defensores del Hombre. Ha descubierto que tienen su propia prole zerg y que la usan para organizar ataques en mundos del Dominio en todo el sector. Ahora, el equipo de Nova se enfrenta a un inminente ataque zerg en un planeta repleto de civiles.
Map/Summary/Nova04=Aunque era demasiado tarde para detener la infestación de Tyrador IX, Nova ha salvado a los civiles supervivientes del planeta de los zerg y de los tal'darim. No obstante, sus esfuerzos también han fortalecido a los Defensores del Hombre, que se han atribuido el mérito de la evacuación.
Map/Summary/Nova05=Tras salir triunfante del desafío de Alarak, ahora Nova posee el terrazine que necesita para recordar su pasado con los Defensores del Hombre. A pesar del riesgo que supone, está segura de que, si utiliza el terrazine, descubrirá la identidad de su líder.
Map/Summary/Nova06=Nova ha descubierto la inquietante verdad sobre el tiempo que pasó con los Defensores del Hombre y ahora tiene la prueba que necesita para llevarlos ante la justicia. No obstante, Valerian le ha ordenado que espere y que confíe en su plan... que incluye dejar de ser Emperador del Dominio.
Map/Summary/Nova07=Nova se ha infiltrado con éxito en las instalaciones de Davis y la ha arrestado. Cuando Valerian, al final de su discurso, revele las pruebas de los crímenes de Davis como líder de los Defensores del Hombre, el Dominio podrá recobrar la paz por fin.
Map/Summary/Nova08=Con la ayuda del Dominio y de los desertores de los Defensores del Hombre, Nova ha rechazado el ataque de la flota de la muerte contra Vardona. Pero Davis ha aprovechado el caos de la batalla para escapar. Ahora Nova debe encontrarla y entregarla a la justicia de una vez por todas.
Map/Summary/Nova09=Los Defensores del Hombre han sido derrotados, y Davis ha muerto. Al matarla, Nova desobedeció una orden directa y ahora es una fugitiva. A pesar de ello, está dispuesta a seguir liderando a su tripulación para luchar por el Dominio a su manera.</n></n>Gracias al trabajo de un operativo especial, se ha destapado y desmantelado una conspiración que ha costado innumerables vidas inocentes. Así concluye la historia de Nova: Operación Sigilo. Gracias por todo.
