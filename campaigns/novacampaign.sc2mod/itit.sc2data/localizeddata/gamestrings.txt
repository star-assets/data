Map/LoadingHelp/Nova01=Nova è un'unità eroica dotata di abilità speciali. Potrai selezionarla premendo il tasto <c val="ffff00"><k val="HeroSelect0"/></c> o cliccando sulla sua icona, nell'angolo in alto a sinistra dello schermo.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova02=Le forze nemiche hanno bisogno di unità volanti per vedere le tue unità sulle alture. Sfruttale per tendere imboscate ed evitare rappresaglie.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova03=Difendi la tua base con Bunker e Carri d'assedio. Se subiscono danni, usa gli SCV per ripararli.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova04=Le Banshee infliggono molti danni, ma ne possono tollerare pochi. Sfrutta l'occultamento ed evita gli individuatori per tenerle in vita.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova05=Schierare dei Liberatori in Assetto difensore sulle strettoie è una strategia di difesa efficace.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova06=Prova diverse soluzioni di equipaggiamento e tecnologie di unità per meglio affrontare i nemici che ti aspettano.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova07=Durante le missioni d'infiltrazione, può essere utile usare l'Interdizione d'Ingaggio <k val="Ghost,GhostHoldFire,1,2"/> di Nova per impedirle di attaccare automaticamente bersagli nemici.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova08=La battaglia infuria in tutta la città. Usa il sistema di tunnel ferroviari per trasportare rapidamente l'armata da un punto all'altro.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova09=Lo Xanthos può ripararsi dopo aver subito danni, ma è vulnerabile durante questo processo. Abbattilo prima che finisca le riparazioni.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova01=Un corretto uso delle abilità di Nova è fondamentale. Sfrutta Tiro di precisione per eliminare i Fantasmi avversari e Granate a impulsi per decimare ampi gruppi di nemici.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova02=Costruisci altre Caserme o Reattori per produrre più unità contemporaneamente.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova03=Ordinando alle unità di attaccare un punto del terreno, queste attaccheranno tutti i nemici incontrati lungo il percorso. Questa manovra è detta "movimento d'attacco".
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova04=Gli zerg reagiranno dopo che la base di Nova sarà stata stabilita. Distruggi il maggior numero possibile di Vivai per indebolire i loro futuri attacchi.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova05=I dispositivi di estrazione attirano gli infestati. Stabilisci le tue difese prima di iniziare il processo.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova06=Le selezioni effettuate durante le scene di flashback determinano le forze nemiche che si incontreranno. Scegli con attenzione.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova07=Se uno scontro si rivela troppo difficile, prova ad affrontarlo con diverso equipaggiamento.

Map/Summary/Nova01=Nova è fuggita da un misterioso complesso in cui era tenuta prigioniera assieme ad altri Fantasmi. Ora tenta di stabilire un contatto con il Dominio, nella speranza che la possano aiutare a far luce su cosa è successo e sul motivo della sua permanenza in quel luogo.
Map/Summary/Nova02=Nova ha scoperto di essere ricercata per tradimento con l'accusa di aver collaborato con un gruppo terrorista noto come i Difensori dell'Umanità, responsabile anche di aver scatenato un attacco zerg sul pianeta Borea. Ora che ha fatto ritorno tra le fila del Dominio, tocca a lei scoprire i piani dei Difensori.
Map/Summary/Nova03=Dopo aver recuperato parte dei suoi ricordi, Nova ha localizzato una base dei Difensori dell'Umanità su Tarsonis ed è penetrata al suo interno. Ha scoperto che stanno controllando una genia zerg per attaccare pianeti del Dominio in tutto il settore. Secondo i piani, è imminente un altro attacco zerg su un mondo densamente popolato.
Map/Summary/Nova04=Anche se non è riuscita ad arrestare l'infestazione di Tyrador IX, Nova ha salvato i civili sopravvissuti dalla minaccia rappresentata da zerg e Tal'darim. I suoi sforzi hanno però rafforzato i Difensori dell'Umanità, che si sono presi il merito dell'evacuazione.
Map/Summary/Nova05=Nova ha superato la sfida di Alarak e ora possiede il terrazine necessario a recuperare i ricordi del tempo trascorso con i Difensori dell'Umanità. La procedura è rischiosa, ma Nova è sicura che usare il terrazine le consentirà di scoprire l'identità del capo dei ribelli.
Map/Summary/Nova06=Nova ha scoperto la realtà sulla sua collaborazione coi Difensori dell'Umanità: ora dispone di prove a sufficienti per consegnarli alla giustizia. Valerian, però, le ha ordinato di attendere e di fidarsi del suo piano... che prevede la sua rinuncia al titolo di Imperatore.
Map/Summary/Nova07=Nova si è infiltrata con successo nella base del generale Carolina Davis e l'ha arrestata. Una volta che Valerian avrà svelato le prove dei crimini del generale e la sua implicazione con i Difensori dell'Umanità, il Dominio potrà finalmente ritrovare la pace.
Map/Summary/Nova08=Collaborando con le forze del Dominio e con i disertori dei Difensori dell'Umanità, Nova ha respinto l'attacco della Flotta della Morte a Vardona. Tuttavia, Davis ha approfittato della confusione per fuggire. Ora, Nova la deve rintracciare per consegnarla definitivamente alla giustizia.
Map/Summary/Nova09=I Difensori dell'Umanità sono stati sconfitti, e Carolina Davis è morta. Avendo contravvenuto all'ordine di ucciderla, Nova si è data alla fuga. Nonostante il suo stato di fuggitiva, è pronta a guidare la sua squadra a sostegno del Dominio, ma alle sue condizioni.</n></n>I suoi sforzi hanno consentito di portare alla luce e sventare una cospirazione che è costata innumerevoli vite innocenti e di ristabilire l'ordine. Questo conclude la campagna di Nova: Operazioni Segrete. Grazie per avervi preso parte.
